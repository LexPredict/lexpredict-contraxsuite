<p>In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe llp, Bond Counsel to the Authority, based upon an analysis of existing laws, 
regulations, rulings and court decisions, and assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with 
certain covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under Section 103 of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes.  In the further opinion of Bond Counsel, interest on the 
Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, although Bond Counsel 
observes that such interest is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable income.  Bond 
Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any other tax consequences related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or 
receipt of interest on, the Bonds.  See “TAX MATTERS” herein.

</p>
<p>The Authority is a public instrumentality of the State organized and existing under and by virtue 
of the California Health Facilities Financing Authority Act, constituting Part 7.2 of Division 3 of Title 2 
of the California Government Code (the “Act”).  The intent of the State legislature in enacting the Act 
was to provide financing to health facilities and to pass along to the consuming public all or part of any 
savings realized by a participating health institution (as defined in the Act) as a result of tax-exempt 
financing.  Pursuant to the Act, the Authority is authorized to issue its revenue bonds for the purpose of 
financing (including reimbursing expenditures made or refinancing indebtedness incurred for such 
purpose) the construction, expansion, remodeling, renovation, furnishing, equipping or acquisition of 
health facilities operated by participating health institutions.  The State Treasurer is authorized under the 
Act to sell such revenue bonds on behalf of the Authority. 
</p>
<p>Organization and Membership 
</p>
<p>The Act provides that the Authority shall consist of nine members, including the State Treasurer, 
who shall serve as Chairman, the Controller of the State, the Director of Finance of the State and two 
members appointed by each of the State Senate Rules Committee, the Speaker of the State Assembly and 
the Governor of the State.  The Chairman of the Authority appoints the Executive Director. 
</p>
<p>Outstanding Indebtedness of the Authority 
</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2017, the Authority had issued obligations aggregating $39,718,382,017 in 
original principal amount and had outstanding obligations in the aggregate principal amount of 
$16,927,304,063. 
</p>
<p>THE BONDS 
</p>
<p>The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Bonds.  Reference is made to the Bonds 
for the complete text thereof and to the Indenture for all of the provisions relating to the Bonds.  The 
discussion herein is qualified by such reference. 
</p>
<p>General 
</p>
<p>The Bonds are being issued pursuant to the Indenture in the aggregate principal amount set forth 
on the cover of this Official Statement.  The Bonds will be delivered in fully registered form without

Gross Revenue Accounts; Grant of Security Interest in Collateral. For so long as any of the
Obligations remain outstanding, pursuant to the Master Indenture, the Corporation and each of the other
Members of the Obligated Group, if any, have covenanted and agreed to deposit all Gross Revenues in a
deposit account or securities account designated as the “Gross Revenue Accounts,” at such banking
institution as the Corporation shall designate from time to time for such purpose (each a “Depository
Bank”). The Corporation has entered into an Account Control Agreement for each Gross Revenue
Account with a Depository Bank and the Master Trustee. As security for the payment of Required
Payments and the performance of the other obligations of the Members of the Obligated Group under the
Master Indenture, the Corporation and each of the other Members of the Obligated Group, if any, have
pledged and assigned and granted to the Master Trustee a security interest in all Gross Revenues, all

</p>
<p>Gross Revenue Accounts, all accounts and accounts receivable (including health-care-insurance 
receivables) and all proceeds of any of the foregoing (the “Collateral”).  Subject to compliance with the 
terms and provisions of the Master Indenture, Gross Revenues and the amounts on deposit in the Gross 
Revenue Account may be used and withdrawn by the Corporation and each other Member of the 
Obligated Group, if any, for any lawful purpose.  See APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL 
DOCUMENTS—Master Indenture of Trust—Particular Covenants of the Members—Gross Revenue 
Accounts.”
</p>
<p>The foregoing grant of a security interest in the Collateral has been perfected to the extent, and 
only to the extent, that such security interest may be perfected under the Uniform Commercial Code of 
the State of California.  The foregoing grant of a security interest may be subordinated to the interest and 
claims of others in several instances.  Some examples of cases of subordination of prior interests and 
claims are (i) statutory liens, (ii) rights arising in favor of the United States of America or any agency 
thereof, (iii) present or future prohibitions against assignment in any federal statutes or regulations, 
(iv) constructive trusts, equitable liens or other rights impressed or conferred by any state or federal court 
in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction, (v) federal or state bankruptcy laws that may affect the 
enforceability of the Master Indenture or grant of a security interest in the Collateral, and (vi) rights of 
third parties in Gross Revenues converted to cash and not in the possession of the Master Trustee or a 
Depository Bank.  In addition, it may not be possible to perfect a security interest in any manner 
whatsoever in certain types of Collateral (e.g., gifts, donations, certain insurance proceeds, Medicare and 
Medi-Cal payments) prior to actual receipt by any Member of the Obligated Group for deposit in the 
Gross Revenue Accounts. 
</p>
<p>Unsecured Debt.  Except for the pledge of the Collateral described above (see “Gross Revenue 
Accounts; Grant of Security Interest in Collateral”), Obligations issued under the Master Indenture are not 
secured by a lien on real or personal property of the Members of the Obligated Group.  Accordingly, 
holders of Obligations, including the Trustee as holder of Obligation No. 15, would likely be unsecured 
creditors in any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding involving a Member of the Obligated Group.  For a 
description of the limitations on the enforceability of the Master Indenture, see “Security and 
Enforceability” below. 
</p>
<p>Covenant against Liens.  Pursuant to the Master Indenture, each Member of the Obligated Group 
agrees that it will not create, assume or suffer to exist any Lien upon the Property of the Obligated Group 
unless all Obligations are secured prior to or equally and ratably with any such Indebtedness or other 
obligation secured by such Lien.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Member of the Obligated Group 
may create, assume or suffer to exist Permitted Encumbrances.  See APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF 
PRINCIPAL DOCUMENTS—Master Indenture of Trust—Particular Covenants of the Members—
Negative Pledge.” 
</p>
<p>Additional Indebtedness and Outstanding Indebtedness.  The Members of the Obligated Group 
may incur additional indebtedness, provided that the Obligated Group meets certain requirements 
prescribed by the Master Indenture.  See APPENDIX C – “SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL 
DOCUMENTS—Master Indenture of Trust—Particular Covenants of the Members—Limitations on 
Indebtedness.”  The additional indebtedness may be incurred as an Obligation issued under the Master 
Indenture or as other indebtedness and may be secured or unsecured. 
</p>
<p>Upon the issuance of the Bonds, the aggregate principal amount of Obligations issued and 
outstanding under the Master Indenture related to long-term indebtedness will be $815,870,000.  See

<p>Bankruptcy.  In the event of bankruptcy of the Corporation, the rights and remedies of the 
Bondholders are subject to various provisions of the federal Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”).  
If the Corporation were to file a petition in bankruptcy, payments made by the Corporation during the 
90 day (or perhaps one-year) period immediately preceding the filing of such petition may be avoidable as 
preferential transfers to the extent such payments allow the recipients thereof to receive more than they 
would have received in the event of such entity’s liquidation.  Security interests and other liens granted to 
a trustee, including the Trustee and the Master Trustee, and perfected during such preference period also 
may be avoided as preferential transfers to the extent such security interest or other lien secures 
obligations that arose prior to the date of such perfection.  Such a bankruptcy filing would operate as an 
automatic stay of the commencement or continuation of any judicial or other proceeding against the 
Corporation and its property and as an automatic stay of any act or proceeding to enforce a lien upon or to 
otherwise exercise control over such property, as well as various other actions to enforce, maintain or 
enhance the rights of a trustee.  If the bankruptcy court so ordered, the property of the Corporation, 
including accounts receivable and proceeds thereof, could be used for the financial rehabilitation of the 
Corporation despite any security interest of a trustee therein.  The rights of a trustee to enforce its security 
interests and other liens could be delayed during the pendency of the rehabilitation proceeding. 
</p>
<p>The Corporation could file a plan for the adjustment of its debts in any such proceeding, which 
could include provisions modifying or altering the rights of creditors generally or any class of them, 
secured or unsecured.  The plan, when confirmed by a court, binds all creditors who had notice or 
knowledge of the plan and, with certain exceptions, discharges all claims against the debtor to the extent 
provided for in the plan.  No plan may be confirmed unless certain conditions are met, among which are 
conditions that the plan be feasible and that it shall have been accepted by each class of claims impaired 
thereunder.  Each class of claims has accepted the plan if at least two-thirds in dollar amount and more 
than one-half in number of the class cast votes in its favor.  Even if the plan is not so accepted, it may be 
confirmed if the court finds that the plan is fair and equitable with respect to each class of non-accepting 
creditors impaired thereunder and does not discriminate unfairly. 
</p>
<p>In addition, the obligations of the Corporation under the Loan Agreement are not secured by a 
lien on or security interest in any assets or revenues of the Corporation, other than the lien on Gross 
Revenues and in the funds on deposit in the Gross Revenue Accounts, as described herein, securing all 
Obligations issued under the Master Indenture, including Obligation No. 15.  Except with respect to such 
lien on Gross Revenues, in the event of a bankruptcy of the Corporation, Bondholders would be 
unsecured creditors and would be in an inferior position to any secured creditors and on a parity with all 
other unsecured creditors. 
</p>
<p>In the event of bankruptcy of the Corporation, there is no assurance that certain covenants, 
including tax covenants, contained in the Loan Agreement or other documents would survive.  
Accordingly, a bankruptcy trustee could take action that would adversely affect the exclusion of interest 
on the Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes. 
</p>
<p>Risks Related to Master Indenture Financings; Fraudulent Transfer or Conveyance Statutes.
On the Closing Date, the Corporation will be the only Member of the Obligated Group, and,

institutions join the Obligated Group in the future, the risks described below would be relevant.

creditors impaired thereunder and does not discriminate unfairly.

In addition, the obligations of the Corporation under the Loan Agreement are not secured by a
lien on or security interest in any assets or revenues of the Corporation, other than the lien on Gross
Revenues and in the funds on deposit in the Gross Revenue Accounts, as described herein, securing all
Obligations issued under the Master Indenture, including Obligation No. 15. Except with respect to such
lien on Gross Revenues, in the event of a bankruptcy of the Corporation, Bondholders would be
unsecured creditors and would be in an inferior position to any secured creditors and on a parity with all
other unsecured creditors.

In the event of bankruptcy of the Corporation, there is no assurance that certain covenants,
including tax covenants, contained in the Loan Agreement or other documents would survive.
Accordingly, a bankruptcy trustee could take action that would adversely affect the exclusion of interest

Risks Related to Master Indenture Financings,; Fraudulent Transfer or Conveyance Statutes.
On the Closing Date, the Corporation will be the only Member of the Obligated Group, and,
consequently, the risks described below in this section would not apply. However, should other
institutions join the Obligated Group in the future, the risks described below would be relevant.

The state of insolvency, fraudulent transfer or conveyance and bankruptcy laws relating to the
enforceability of obligations of one corporation in favor of the creditors of another, or the obligation of
one member of an obligated group to make debt service payments on behalf of another member or the
</div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  10 
</p>
<p>ability of a corporate parent to compel its affiliates or subsidiaries to make such payments is unsettled.  
The ability of the Master Trustee or the Corporation to compel one Member of the Obligated Group to 
make payment on behalf of another Member could be subject to challenge if such Member would, by 
make such payment, be rendered insolvent.  In particular, such efforts by the Master Trustee or the 
Corporation may not be enforced under the Bankruptcy Code or applicable state fraudulent transfer or 
conveyance statutes if the obligation to pay is incurred without “fair consideration” or “reasonably 
equivalent value” to the obligor-Member and if the incurrence of the obligation renders the Member 
insolvent.  The standards for determining the fairness of consideration and the manner of determining 
insolvency are matters of judicial discretion based upon subjective standards and may vary under the 
Bankruptcy Code and other statutes that may be applicable. 
</p>
<p>In addition a court could determine, in the event of a bankruptcy of a Member, that payments 
made on Obligation No. 15 by a bankrupt Member could constitute payments to or for the benefit of an 
insider, within the meaning of Section 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, which payments, if made within 
one year of the filing of the bankruptcy petition, might be recoverable by the bankruptcy court from the 
owners of the Bonds. 
</p>
<p>If a court were to find that a Member did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent 
value for the incurrence of the indebtedness evidenced by Obligation No. 15 and such Member: (i) was 
insolvent; (ii) was rendered insolvent by such incurrence; (iii) was engaged in a business activity for 
which its remaining assets were unreasonably small; or (iv) intended (or believed) to incur, assume or 
issue, debt beyond its ability to pay, a court could determine to invalidate, the indebtedness represented 
by Obligation No. 15. 
</p>
<p>Enforceability of the Loan Agreement.  The legal right and practical ability of the Trustee to 
enforce rights and remedies under the Loan Agreement may be limited by laws relating to bankruptcy, 
insolvency, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or moratorium and by other similar laws affecting 
creditors rights.  In addition, enforcement of such rights and remedies will depend upon the exercise of 
various remedies specified by such documents, which, in many instances, may require judicial actions 
that are subject to discretion and delay, that otherwise may not be readily available or that may be limited 
by certain legal principles. 
</p>
<p>There exists common law authority and authority under certain statutes for the ability of the 
courts to terminate the existence of a nonprofit corporation or undertake supervision of its affairs on 
various grounds, including a finding that such corporation has insufficient assets to carry out its stated 
charitable purposes.  Such court action may arise on the court’s own motion or pursuant to a petition of 
the state or such other persons who have interests different from those of the general public, pursuant to 
the common law and statutory power to enforce charitable trusts and to see to the application of their 
funds to their intended charitable uses. 
</p>
<p>The various legal opinions delivered concurrently with the issuance of the Bonds will be qualified 
as to the enforceability of the various legal instruments by limitations imposed by state and federal laws, 
rulings, policy and decisions affecting remedies and by bankruptcy, reorganization or other laws of 
general application affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights or the enforceability of certain remedies 
or document provisions. 
</p>
<p>Enforceability of Security Interests.  The security interest in Gross Revenues is perfected to the 
extent, and only to the extent, that such security interest may be perfected under the California 
Commercial Code.  The foregoing grant of a security interest may be subordinated to the interest and 
claims of others in several instances.  Some examples of cases of subordination of prior interests and 
claims are (i) statutory liens, (ii) rights arising in favor of the United States of America or any agency </p>

BONDHOLDERS’ RISKS

The purchase of the Bonds involves investment risks that are discussed throughout this Official
Statement. Prospective purchasers of the Bonds should evaluate all of the information presented in this
Official Statement. This section on Bondholders’ Risks focuses primarily on the general risks associated
with hospital or health system operations, whereas APPENDIX A describes the Corporation specifically.
These should be read together.

General

Except as noted under “SECURITY AND SOURCE OF PAYMENT FOR THE BONDS,” the
Bonds are payable from Loan Repayments made pursuant to the Loan Agreement and from funds
provided under Obligation No. 15 and the Indenture. No representation or assurance can be made that
revenues will be realized by the Corporation in amounts sufficient to pay principal of and interest on the
Bonds.

The Corporation is subject to a wide variety of federal and state regulatory actions and legislative
and policy changes by those governmental and private agencies that administer Medicare, Medicaid and
other payors and is subject to actions by, among others, the National Labor Relations Board, The Joint
Commission, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (“CMS”) of the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services (“DHHS”), the Attorney General of the State of California (the “State’’), and other
federal, state and local government agencies. The future financial condition of the Corporation could be
adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the method, timing and amount of payments to the
Corporation by governmental and nongovernmental payors, the financial viability of these payors,
increased competition from other health care entities, the costs associated with responding to
governmental audits, inquiries and investigations, demand for health care, other forms of care or
treatment, changes in the methods by which employers purchase health care for employees, capability of
management, changes in the structure of how health care is delivered and paid for (e.g., accountable care
organizations (“ACOs”), value based purchasing, bundled payments and other health reform payment
mechanisms, including a “single-payor” system), future changes in the economy, demographic changes,
availability of physicians, nurses and other health care professionals, and malpractice claims and other
litigation. These factors and others may adversely affect payment by the Corporation and any future
Member of the Obligated Group pursuant to the Loan Agreement and Obligation No. 15 and,
consequently, on the Bonds. In addition, the tax-exempt status of the Corporation and any future
Obligated Group Member and, therefore, of the Bonds, could be adversely affected by, among other
things, an adverse determination by a governmental entity, noncompliance with governmental regulations
or legislative changes, including changes resulting from current health care reform legislation or
initiatives. See “—Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax Matters” below.

<p>Significant Risk Areas Summarized 
</p>
<p>Certain of the primary risks associated with the operations of the Corporation are briefly 
summarized in general terms below and are explained in greater detail in subsequent sections.  The 
occurrence of one or more of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the financial conditions 
and results of operations of the Corporation or any future Member of the Obligated Group and, in turn, 
the ability of the Obligated Group to make payments under the Loan Agreement and Obligation No. 15.  
For discussions of the applicability of certain of these risks to the Corporation, see APPENDIX A – 
“INFORMATION CONCERNING LUCILE SALTER PACKARD CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AT 
STANFORD.”  
</p>
<p>Federal Health Care Reform and Deficit Reduction.  The Patient Protection and Affordable 
Care Act, as enacted in March 2010 and as subsequently amended (the “ACA”), impacts almost all 
aspects of hospital and provider operations and health care delivery, and has changed and is changing 
how health care services are covered, delivered, and reimbursed.  These changes will result in new 
payment models with the risk of lower hospital reimbursement from Medicare, utilization changes, 
increased government enforcement and the necessity for health care providers to assess, and potentially 
alter, their business strategy and practices, among other consequences.  It is unclear how efforts to repeal 
the legislation and lawsuits to challenge its provisions will be resolved.  Uncertainties regarding 
implementation of the ACA create unpredictability for the strategic and business planning efforts of 
health care providers, which in itself creates risk.  Requirements for state “health information exchanges” 
could fundamentally alter the health insurance market by giving the health information exchanges a rate-
setting role, negatively impacting hospital providers. 
</p>
<p>In recent years, federal policymakers have undertaken various efforts to reduce the federal deficit, 
principally by reducing federal spending on entitlement programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.  
Additional attempts to curb federal entitlement program spending are likely, and federal deficit reduction 
efforts would likely curb federal Medicare and Medicaid spending further to the detriment of hospitals, 
physicians and other health care providers.  From time to time, there may be legislative or judicial efforts 
to repeal or substantially modify provisions of the ACA.  See “—Health Care Reform” below. 
</p>
<p>Tax Reform.  Tax legislation, administrative actions taken by tax authorities, or court decisions, 
whether at the federal or state level, may adversely affect the tax-exempt status of interest on the Bonds 
under federal or state law or otherwise prevent beneficial owners of the Bonds from realizing the full 
current benefit of the tax status of such interest.  In addition, such legislation or actions (whether currently 
proposed, proposed in the future, or enacted) and such decisions could affect the market price or 
marketability of the Bonds.  The Trump administration has announced several tax reform proposals.  
While few specifics are available, the Trump administration’s announcements indicate the intent to 
eliminate most deductions, which may include the exclusion of interest on tax-exempt bonds such as the 
Bonds from gross income for federal income tax purposes. 
</p>
<p>Rate Pressure from Insurers and Purchasers. Certain health care markets, including many 
communities in California, are strongly impacted by large health insurers and, in some cases, by major 
purchasers of health services.  In those areas, health insurers may have significant influence over the 
rates, utilization and competition of hospitals and other health care providers.  Rate pressure imposed by 
health insurers or other major purchasers, including managed care payers, may have a material adverse 
impact on health care providers, particularly if major purchasers put increasing pressure on payers to 
restrain rate increases.  Business failures by health insurers also could have a material adverse impact on 
contracted hospitals and other health care providers in the form of payment shortfalls or delay, and/or 
continuing obligations to care for managed care patients without receiving payment.  In addition, disputes 
with non-contracted payers may result in an inability to collect billed charges from these payers. </p>

Tax Reform. Tax legislation, administrative actions taken by tax authorities, or court decisions,
whether at the federal or state level, may adversely affect the tax-exempt status of interest on the Bonds
under federal or state law or otherwise prevent beneficial owners of the Bonds from realizing the full
current benefit of the tax status of such interest. In addition, such legislation or actions (whether currently

<p>  16 
</p>
<p>State Medicaid Program.  The State’s Medicaid program (known as “Medi-Cal”) and other state 
health care programs are an important payor source for many hospitals, including the Corporation.  These 
programs often pay hospitals and physicians at levels that may be below the actual cost of the care 
provided.  As Medi-Cal and other State health care programs are partially funded by the State, the 
financial condition of the State may result in lower funding levels and/or payment delays in the future.  
These could have a material adverse impact on hospitals, including the Corporation, and other health care 
providers. 
</p>
<p>General Economic Conditions, Bad Debt, Indigent Care and Investment Performance.  Health 
care providers are economically influenced by the environment in which they operate.  Any national 
economic difficulties may constrain corporate and personal spending, limit the availability of credit and 
increase the national debt and federal and certain state government deficits.  To the extent that 
unemployment rates are high, employers reduce their workforces and their budgets for employee health 
care coverage or private and public insurers seek to reduce payments to health care providers or curb 
utilization of health care services, health care providers may experience decreases in insured patient 
volume and reductions in payments for services.  In addition, to the extent that state, county or city 
governments are unable to provide a safety net of medical services, pressure is applied to local health care 
providers to increase free care.  Economic downturns and lower funding of federal Medicare and state 
Medicaid and other state health care programs may increase the number of patients who are unable to pay 
for some or all of their medical and hospital services.  These conditions may give rise to increases in 
health care providers’ uncollectible accounts, or “bad debt,” uninsured discount and charity care and, 
consequently, to reductions in operating income.  Declines in investment portfolio values may reduce or 
eliminate non-operating revenues.  Investment losses (even if unrealized) may trigger debt covenant 
violations and may jeopardize hospitals’ economic security.  Losses in pension and other postretirement 
benefit funds may result in increased funding requirements for hospitals and health systems.  Potential 
failure of lenders, insurers or vendors may negatively impact the results of operations and the overall 
financial condition of health care providers.  Philanthropic support may also decrease or be delayed.  
These factors may have a material adverse impact on hospitals and other health care providers. 
</p>
<p>Debt Limit Increase.  Through legislation, the federal government has created a debt “ceiling” or 
limit on the amount of debt that may be issued by the United States Treasury.  In the past several years, 
political disputes have arisen within the federal government in connection with discussions concerning 
the authorization for an increase in the federal debt ceiling.  Any failure by Congress to increase the 
federal debt limit may impact the federal government’s ability to incur additional debt, pay its existing 
debt instruments and to satisfy its obligations relating to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
</p>
<p>Management of the Corporation is unable to determine at this time what impact any future failure 
to increase the federal debt limit may have on the operations and financial condition of the Corporation, 
although such impact may be material.  Additionally, the market price or marketability of the Bonds in 
the secondary market may be materially adversely impacted by any failure to increase the federal debt 
limit. 
</p>
<p>Nonprofit Health Care Environment.  The significant tax benefits received by nonprofit, tax-
exempt hospitals have increasingly caused the business practices of such hospitals to be subject to 
scrutiny by public officials and the press, and to political and legal challenges of the ongoing qualification 
of such organizations for tax-exempt status.  Multiple governmental authorities, including state attorneys 
general, the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), Congress, and state legislatures have held hearings and 
carried out audits regarding the conduct of tax-exempt organizations, including tax-exempt hospitals.  
Citizen organizations, such as labor unions and patient advocates, have also focused public attention on 
the activities of tax-exempt hospitals and health systems and raised questions about their practices.  The 
IRS imposes certain reporting requirements on hospitals and health systems, including through </p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  17 
</p>
<p>Schedule H, Schedule J and Schedule K of the IRS Form 990 (“Form 990”).  Proposals to stiffen the 
regulatory requirements for nonprofit hospitals’ retention of tax-exempt status, such as by establishing a 
minimum level of charity care, have also been introduced repeatedly in Congress.  These challenges and 
examinations, and any resulting legislation, regulations, judgments or penalties, could materially change 
the operating environment for nonprofit providers and have a material adverse effect on the Corporation.  
Significant changes in the obligations of nonprofit, tax-exempt hospitals and challenges to or loss of the 
tax-exempt status of nonprofit hospitals generally, or the Corporation in particular, could have a material 
adverse effect on the Corporation.  See “—Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax Matters—Maintenance of 
Tax-Exempt Status of Interest on the Bonds” below. 
</p>
<p>Capital Needs vs. Capital Capacity.  Hospital and other health care operations are capital 
intensive.  Regulation, technology and physician/patient expectations require constant and often 
significant capital investment.  In California, seismic safety standards mandated by the State may require 
that many hospital facilities be substantially modified, replaced or closed.  Nearly all hospitals in 
California are affected.  Estimated construction costs are substantial and actual costs of compliance may 
exceed estimates.  Total capital needs may exceed capital capacity.  Furthermore, capital capacity of 
hospitals and health systems may be reduced as a result of credit market dislocations. 
</p>
<p>Construction Risks.  Construction projects are subject to a variety of risks, including but not 
limited to delays in issuance of required building permits or other necessary approvals or permits, 
including environmental approvals, strikes, shortages of materials and labor, and adverse weather 
conditions.  Such events could delay occupancy.  Cost overruns may occur due to change orders, delays in 
the construction schedule, scarcity of building materials and labor and other factors.  Cost overruns could 
cause the costs to exceed available funds.  See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING 
LUCILE SALTER PACKARD CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AT STANFORD—THE PROJECT.” 
</p>
<p>Government “Fraud” Enforcement.  “Fraud” in government funded health care programs is of 
significant concern to the federal government and state regulatory agencies overseeing health care 
programs, and is one of the federal government’s prime law enforcement priorities.  The federal 
government and, to a lesser degree, state governments impose a wide variety of extraordinarily complex 
and technical requirements intended to prevent over-utilization based on economic inducements, 
misallocation of expenses, overcharging and other forms of “fraud” in the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs, as well as other state and federally-funded health care programs.  This body of regulation 
impacts a broad spectrum of hospital and other health care provider commercial activity, including 
licensing, billing, accounting, recordkeeping, medical staff oversight, medical necessity determinations, 
quality assurance, physician contracting and recruiting, cost allocation, clinical trials, discounts and other 
functions and transactions. 
</p>
<p>Violations and alleged violations may be deliberate, but also frequently occur in circumstances 
where management is unaware of the conduct in question, as a result of mistake, or where the individual 
participants do not know that their conduct is in violation of law.  Violations may occur and be prosecuted 
in circumstances that do not have the traditional elements of fraud, and enforcement actions may extend 
to conduct that occurred in the past.  Violations may carry significant sanctions.  The government 
periodically conducts widespread investigations covering categories of services or certain accounting, 
coding or billing practices. 
</p>
<p>Violations and Sanctions.  The government and/or private “whistleblowers” often pursue 
aggressive investigative and enforcement actions.  The government has a wide array of civil, criminal, 
monetary and other penalties, including suspending essential hospital and other health care provider 
payments from the Medicare or Medicaid programs, or exclusion from those programs.  Aggressive 
investigation tactics, negative publicity and threatened penalties can be, and often are, used to force </p>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  18 
</p>
<p>settlements, payment of fines and compliance with prospective restrictions that may have a materially 
adverse impact on hospital and other health care provider operations, financial condition, results of 
operations and reputation.  Multi-million dollar fines and settlements for alleged intentional misconduct, 
fraud or false claims are not uncommon in the health care industry.  These risks are generally uninsured.  
Government enforcement and private whistleblower suits may continue to increase in the hospital and 
health care sector.  Many large hospital and other health care provider systems are likely to be adversely 
impacted by actions or claims of this kind. 
</p>
<p>Personnel Shortage.  From time to time, shortages of physicians and nursing and other technical 
personnel occur, which may impact hospitals and health care systems.  Various studies have predicted 
that physician and nurse shortages will become more acute over time, as practitioners retire and patient 
volume exceeds the growth in new professionals.  As reimbursement amounts are reduced to health care 
facilities and organizations that employ or contract with physicians, nurses and other health care 
professionals, pressure to control and possibly reduce wage and benefit costs may further strain the supply 
of those professionals.  In California, regulation of nurse staff ratios can intensify the potential shortage of 
nursing personnel.  In addition, shortages of other professional and technical staff such as pharmacists, 
therapists, laboratory technicians, billing coders and others may occur or worsen.  Hospital operations, 
patient and physician satisfaction, financial condition and future growth could be negatively affected by 
physician and nursing and other technical personnel shortages, resulting in material adverse impact to 
hospitals and health care systems. 
</p>
<p>Technical and Clinical Developments.  New clinical techniques and technology, as well as new 
pharmaceutical and genetic developments and products, may alter the course of medical diagnosis and 
treatment in ways that are currently unanticipated, and that may dramatically change medical and hospital 
care.  These developments could result in higher health care costs, significant capital investments, 
reductions in patient populations, lower utilization of hospital service and/or new sources of competition 
for hospitals. 
</p>
<p>Costs and Restrictions from Governmental Regulation.  Nearly every aspect of hospital 
operations and health care delivery is regulated, in some cases by multiple agencies of government.  The 
level and complexity of regulation and compliance audits appear to be increasing, imposing greater 
operational limitations, higher staffing and training requirements, enforcement and liability risks, and 
significant and sometimes unanticipated costs. 
</p>
<p>Proliferation of Competition.  Hospitals increasingly face competition from specialty providers 
of care and ambulatory care facilities.  This competition may cause hospitals to lose essential inpatient or 
outpatient market share.  Competition may be focused on services or payor classifications where hospitals 
realize their highest margins, thus negatively affecting programs that are economically important to 
hospitals.  Specialty hospitals may treat only profitable classifications of patients, leaving full-service 
hospitals with higher acuity and/or lower paying patient populations.  These new sources of competition 
may have a material adverse impact on hospitals, particularly where a group of a hospital’s principal 
physician admitters may curtail their use of a hospital service in favor of a competitor’s facilities. 
</p>
<p>Increasing Consumer Choice.  Hospitals and other health care providers face increased pressure 
to be transparent and provide information about cost and quality of services, which may lead to a loss of 
business as consumers and others make choices about where to receive health care services based upon 
publicly available information. 
</p>
<p>Labor Costs and Disruption.  The delivery of health care services is labor intensive.  Labor costs, 
including salary, benefits and other liabilities associated with the workforce, have significant impact on 
hospital and health care provider operations and financial condition.  Hospital and health care employees </p>

operations and reputation. Multi-million dollar fines and settlements for alleged intentional misconduct,
fraud or false claims are not uncommon in the health care industry. These risks are generally uninsured.
Government enforcement and private whistleblower suits may continue to increase in the hospital and
health care sector. Many large hospital and other health care provider systems are likely to be adversely
impacted by actions or claims of this kind.

Personnel Shortage. From time to time, shortages of physicians and nursing and other technical
personnel occur, which may impact hospitals and health care systems. Various studies have predicted
that physician and nurse shortages will become more acute over time, as practitioners retire and patient
volume exceeds the growth in new professionals. As reimbursement amounts are reduced to health care
facilities and organizations that employ or contract with physicians, nurses and other health care
professionals, pressure to control and possibly reduce wage and benefit costs may further strain the supply
of those professionals. In California, regulation of nurse staff ratios can intensify the potential shortage of
nursing personnel. In addition, shortages of other professional and technical staff such as pharmacists,
therapists, laboratory technicians, billing coders and others may occur or worsen. Hospital operations,
patient and physician satisfaction, financial condition and future growth could be negatively affected by
physician and nursing and other technical personnel shortages, resulting in material adverse impact to
hospitals and health care systems.

Technical and Clinical Developments. New clinical techniques and technology, as well as new
pharmaceutical and genetic developments and products, may alter the course of medical diagnosis and
treatment in ways that are currently unanticipated, and that may dramatically change medical and hospital
care. These developments could result in higher health care costs, significant capital investments,
reductions in patient populations, lower utilization of hospital service and/or new sources of competition
for hospitals.

Costs and Restrictions from Governmental Regulation. Nearly every aspect of hospital
operations and health care delivery is regulated, in some cases by multiple agencies of government. The
level and complexity of regulation and compliance audits appear to be increasing, imposing greater
operational limitations, higher staffing and training requirements, enforcement and liability risks, and
significant and sometimes unanticipated costs.

Proliferation of Competition. Hospitals increasingly face competition from specialty providers
of care and ambulatory care facilities. This competition may cause hospitals to lose essential inpatient or
outpatient market share. Competition may be focused on services or payor classifications where hospitals
realize their highest margins, thus negatively affecting programs that are economically important to
hospitals. Specialty hospitals may treat only profitable classifications of patients, leaving full-service
hospitals with higher acuity and/or lower paying patient populations. These new sources of competition
may have a material adverse impact on hospitals, particularly where a group of a hospital’s principal
physician admitters may curtail their use of a hospital service in favor of a competitor’s facilities.

Increasing Consumer Choice. Hospitals and other health care providers face increased pressure
to be transparent and provide information about cost and quality of services, which may lead to a loss of
business as consumers and others make choices about where to receive health care services based upon
publicly available information.

Labor Costs and Disruption. The delivery of health care services is labor intensive. Labor costs,

including salary, benefits and other liabilities associated with the workforce, have significant impact on
hospital and health care provider operations and financial condition. Hospital and health care employees

18
</div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  19 
</p>
<p>are increasingly organized in collective bargaining units and may be involved in work actions of various 
kinds, including work stoppages and strikes.  Overall costs of the hospital workforce are high, and 
turnover is high.  Pressure to recruit, train and retain qualified employees is expected to accelerate.  These 
factors may materially increase hospital costs of operation.  At the same time, health care organizations 
will be under increasing pressure to reduce the cost of delivering care to patients, including the cost of 
salary and benefits, in order to compete in a transparent price market.  Workforce disruption may 
negatively impact hospital revenues and reputation.  See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION 
CONCERNING LUCILE SALTER PACKARD CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AT STANFORD—OTHER 
INFORMATION—Employees.” 
</p>
<p>Pension and Benefit Funding.  As large employers, hospitals and health care providers may 
incur significant expenses to fund pension and benefit plans for employees and former employees, and to 
fund required workers’ compensation benefits.  Plans are often underfunded or may become underfunded, 
and funding obligations, in some cases, may be erratic or unanticipated and may require significant 
commitments of available cash needed for other purposes. 
</p>
<p>Organizations that are controlled by or under common control with other entities may be jointly 
and severally liable for the defined benefit pension plan obligations of these entities, by virtue of the 
“controlled group” rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) and the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended.  To the extent that a plan sponsor is 
unable to or does not meet the plan’s minimum funding standards or if there are unfunded liabilities upon 
plan termination, members of the controlled group are jointly and severally liable, and any excise tax 
applicable to the unpaid required minimum funding contributions can be levied against the controlled 
group.  The rules permit the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (“PBGC”), the federal agency charged 
with insuring and monitoring defined benefit plans, to impose a lien on the controlled group if required 
minimum funding contributions and unpaid amounts total more than $1 million.  The PBGC also has the 
authority to recover from the members of the plan sponsor’s controlled group amounts that the PBGC 
pays, or assumes the obligation to pay, to plan participants and beneficiaries in connection with a 
termination of an underfunded plan.  The PBGC may also attach a lien to the assets of the plan sponsor’s 
controlled group members to secure its claims for recovery. 
</p>
<p>The Corporation sponsors a defined benefit pension plan, which is frozen to new participants and 
further accruals, and has other pension-related obligations with respect to its workforce.  The Corporation 
is also a member of a controlled group that sponsors two additional defined benefit plans, and the 
Corporation is a participating employer in one of these plans.  See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION

<p>The tax-exempt status afforded nonprofit health care organizations is the subject of increasing 
regulatory and legislative threats.  As a nonprofit tax-exempt organization, the Corporation is subject to 
federal, state and local laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions relating to its organization and

</p>
<p>IRS Examination of Compensation Practices and Community Benefit.  The IRS has 
been historically concerned about executive compensation practices of tax-exempt hospitals.  In 
2004, the IRS began a compliance program to measure compliance by tax-exempt organizations 
with requirements that they not pay excessive compensation and benefits to their officers and 
other insiders.  In February 2009, the IRS issued its Hospital Compliance Project Final Report 
(the “IRS Final Report”) that examined tax-exempt organizations’ practices and procedures with 
regard to compensation and benefits paid to their officers and other defined “insiders.”  The IRS 
Final Report indicated that the IRS will continue to heavily scrutinize executive compensation 
arrangements, practices and procedures of tax-exempt hospitals and other tax-exempt 
organizations and, in certain circumstances, may conduct further investigations or impose fines 
on tax-exempt organizations. 
</p>
<p>The IRS has also undertaken a community benefit initiative directed at hospitals.  The 
IRS Final Report determined that the reporting of community benefit by nonprofit hospitals 
varied widely, both as to types of programs and expenditures classified as community benefit and 
the measurement of community benefits.  Form 990 requires detailed disclosure of compensation 
practices, corporate governance, loans to management and others, joint ventures and other types 
of transactions, political campaign activities, and other areas the IRS deems to be a compliance 
risk.  The Form 990 also requires the disclosure of information on community benefit as well as 
reporting of information related to tax-exempt bonds, including compliance with the arbitrage 
rules and rules limiting private-use of bond-financed facilities, including compliance with the safe 
harbor guidance in connection with management contracts and research contracts.  The Form 990 
is intended to provide enhanced transparency as to the operations of exempt organizations.  See 
“—Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax Matters” below. 
</p>
<p>Revisions to Form 990, Schedule H.  As described below in “—Tax-Exempt Status and 
Other Tax Matters” the ACA contains new requirements for tax-exempt hospitals through 
Section 501(r) of the Code.  Schedule H of Form 990, which hospitals must use to report their 
community benefit activities, has been revised to require details on how a hospital determines 
eligibility for free or discounted care (if the federal poverty guidelines are not used). Consistent 
with Section 501(r) of the Code, Schedule H now requires hospitals to describe billing and 
collection practices permitted under the hospital facility’s policies, as well as information about 
the hospital’s emergency medical care policy, financial assistance policy, and community health 
needs assessments.  Hospitals must complete all of Schedule H, including lines that relate to 
community health needs assessments. 
</p>
<p>Litigation Relating to Billing and Collection Practices.  Lawsuits have been filed in both 
federal and state courts alleging, among other things, that hospitals have failed to fulfill their 
obligations to provide charity care to uninsured patients and have overcharged uninsured patients.  
Some of these cases have since been dismissed by the courts and some hospitals and health 
systems have entered into substantial settlements.  Cases are pending in various courts around the 
country and others could be filed.

<p>care and community benefit to justify their tax-exempt status.  A report was issued in 
August 2012 that summarized the findings and recommended that the California Legislature 
(i) amend state law to include requirements with respect to the amount of community benefits a 
hospital provides, (ii) define a standard methodology for calculating the community benefits a 
hospital delivers, and (iii) amend state law to allow assessment of a penalty against hospitals that 
are not in compliance with submitting community benefit plans to the Office of Statewide Health 
Planning and Development (“OSHPD”).  See “—Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax Matters” 
below.
</p>
<p>Financial Assistance and Charity Care.  California law requires hospitals to maintain 
written policies about discount payment and charity care and provide copies of such policies to 
patients and OSHPD.  California law also requires hospitals to follow specific billing and debt 
collection procedures and communicate proactively through the entire cycle of care to patients on 
the options available to them within the policies.  The Corporation has adopted and maintains 
such policies. 
</p>
<p>Indigent Care.  Tax-exempt health care providers often treat large numbers of indigent 
patients who are unable to pay in full for their medical care.  Typically, urban, inner-city hospitals 
and other health care providers may treat significant numbers of indigents.  These hospitals and 
health care providers may be susceptible to economic and political changes that could increase 
the number of indigents or their responsibility for caring for this population.  General economic 
conditions may affect the number of employed individuals who have health coverage and the 
ability of those individuals to pay for their health care.  Similarly, changes in governmental 
policy, which may result in coverage exclusions under local, county, state and federal health care 
programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) may increase the frequency and severity of indigent 
treatment by such hospitals and other providers.  It also is possible that future legislation could 
require that tax-exempt hospitals and other providers maintain minimum levels of indigent care as 
a condition to federal tax exemption or exemption from certain state or local taxes. 
</p>
<p>Challenges to Real Property Tax Exemptions.  The real property tax exemptions 
afforded to certain nonprofit health care providers by state and local taxing authorities have been 
challenged in certain circumstances on the assertion that the health care providers were not 
engaged in sufficient charitable activities.  These challenges have been based on a variety of 
grounds, including allegations of aggressive billing and collection practices, excessive financial 
margins and operations that closely resemble for-profit businesses. 
</p>
<p>The foregoing are some examples of the challenges and examinations facing nonprofit health care 
organizations.  They are indicative of a greater scrutiny of the billing, collection and other business 
practices of these organizations and may indicate an increasingly difficult operating environment for 
health care organizations, including the Corporation.  The challenges and examinations, and any resulting 
legislation, regulations, judgments, or penalties, could have a material adverse effect on hospitals and 
health care providers, including the Corporation, and, in turn, its ability to make payments under the Loan

<p>Federal Budget Cuts 
</p>
<p>The Budget Control Act of 2011 mandates significant reductions and spending caps on the federal 
budget for fiscal years 2012–2021, including a reduction of 2% on all Medicare payments during this 
period.  Subsequent legislation enacted by Congress extended these reductions through 2025.  There is a

</p>
<p>Because Congress may make changes to the budget in the future, it is impossible to predict the 
impact any spending cuts may have upon the Corporation.  Similarly, it is impossible to predict whether 
any automatic reductions to Medicare may be triggered in lieu of other spending cuts that may be 
proposed by Congress.  If and to the extent Medicare and/or Medicaid spending is reduced under either 
scenario, this may have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition of the Corporation.  
Ultimately, these reductions or alternatives could have a disproportionate impact on hospital providers 
and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Health Care Reform 
</p>
<p>The discussion herein describes risks associated with certain existing federal and State laws, 
regulations, rules, and governmental administrative policies and determinations to which the Corporation 
and the health care industry are subject.  While these are regularly subject to change, many of the existing 
provisions were enacted by or promulgated pursuant to the ACA, to which opposition has been expressed 
by President Trump and the Secretary of DHHS, as well as the majority leaders of each chamber of 
Congress and members of their caucuses.  It is not possible to predict with any certainty whether or when 
the ACA or any specific provision or implementing measure will be repealed, withdrawn or modified in 
any significant respect, but a unified administration and majority in both chambers of Congress could 
enact legislation, withdraw, modify or promulgate rules, regulations and policies, or make determinations 
affecting the Corporation, any of which individually or collectively could have a material adverse effect 
on the operations, financial condition and financial performance of the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>President Trump and certain Congressional leaders have included a repeal of all or a portion of 
the ACA in 2017 in statements concerning their respective legislative agendas, and Congress has already 
taken steps to repeal and replace the ACA.  The repeal effort, to date, has focused on individual and 
employer mandates, exchanges, insurance industry regulations, Medicaid expansion, and the taxes to pay 
for these elements of the ACA.  The timing of such repeal and whether it would be in whole or in part is 
unclear.  It is also unclear when or if a replacement plan would be implemented.  A repeal could result in 
additional pressure on Medicaid and Medicare funding and could have the effect of reducing the 
availability of health insurance to individuals who were previously insured, resulting in greater numbers 
of uninsured individuals, and could otherwise materially adversely affect the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Also, there can be no assurances that any current health care laws and regulations, in addition to 
the ACA, will remain in their current form.  There can be no assurances that any potential changes to the 
laws and regulations governing health care would not have a material adverse financial or operational 
impact on the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Similarly, President Trump and the Congressional majority leaders and members of their 
caucuses have expressed opposition to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 
and have expressed support for “tax reform” measures that would make significant changes to the Code, 
including potential reduction of corporate and personal marginal federal income tax rates.

<p>Therefore, the following discussion should be read with the understanding that significant 
changes could occur in 2017 and beyond in many of the statutory and regulatory matters discussed.

Because Congress may make changes to the budget in the future, it is impossible to predict the
impact any spending cuts may have upon the Corporation. Similarly, it is impossible to predict whether
any automatic reductions to Medicare may be triggered in lieu of other spending cuts that may be
proposed by Congress. If and to the extent Medicare and/or Medicaid spending is reduced under either
scenario, this may have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition of the Corporation.
Ultimately, these reductions or alternatives could have a disproportionate impact on hospital providers
and could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation.

Health Care Reform

The discussion herein describes risks associated with certain existing federal and State laws,
regulations, rules, and governmental administrative policies and determinations to which the Corporation
and the health care industry are subject. While these are regularly subject to change, many of the existing
provisions were enacted by or promulgated pursuant to the ACA, to which opposition has been expressed
by President Trump and the Secretary of DHHS, as well as the majority leaders of each chamber of
Congress and members of their caucuses. It is not possible to predict with any certainty whether or when
the ACA or any specific provision or implementing measure will be repealed, withdrawn or modified in
any significant respect, but a unified administration and majority in both chambers of Congress could
enact legislation, withdraw, modify or promulgate rules, regulations and policies, or make determinations
affecting the Corporation, any of which individually or collectively could have a material adverse effect
on the operations, financial condition and financial performance of the Corporation.

President Trump and certain Congressional leaders have included a repeal of all or a portion of
the ACA in 2017 in statements concerning their respective legislative agendas, and Congress has already

Therefore, the following discussion should be read with the understanding that significant
changes could occur in 2017 and beyond in many of the statutory and regulatory matters discussed.

Federal Health Care Reform. As a result of the ACA, substantial changes have occurred and are

anticipated to occur in the United States health care system. The ACA is impacting the delivery of health
care services, the financing of health care costs, reimbursement of health care providers and the legal

<p>  24 
</p>
<p>obligations of health insurers, providers, employers and consumers.  Because of the complexity of the 
ACA generally, additional legislation may be considered and enacted over time.  The ACA has also 
required, and will continue to require, the promulgation of substantial regulations with significant effects 
on the health care industry.  Thus, the health care industry is the subject of significant new statutory and 
regulatory requirements and consequently to structural and operational changes and challenges for a 
substantial period of time.  The full ramifications of the ACA may also become apparent only over time 
and through later regulatory and judicial interpretations.  Portions of the ACA have already been limited 
and nullified as a result of legislative amendments and judicial interpretations and future actions may 
further change its impact.  The uncertainties regarding the implementation of the ACA create 
unpredictability for the strategic and business planning efforts of health care providers, which in itself 
constitutes a risk. 
</p>
<p>The changes in the health care industry brought about by the ACA may have both positive and 
negative effects, directly and indirectly, on the nation’s hospitals and other health care providers, 
including the Corporation.  For example, the increase in the numbers of individuals with health care 
insurance occurring as a consequence of Medicaid expansion, creation of health insurance exchanges, 
subsidies for insurance purchase and the penalty on certain individuals who do not purchase insurance 
could result in lower levels of bad debt and increased utilization or profitable shifts in utilization patterns 
for hospitals.  Further, the ACA establishes the criteria for the new Qualified Health Plans (“QHPs”) that 
may participate in the state run exchanges.  A QHP must meet certain minimum essential coverage 
requirements.  However, the extent to which Medicaid expansion, which is now optional on a state by 
state basis, is either not pursued or results in a shifting of significant numbers of commercially-insured 
individuals to Medicaid, or health insurance options on exchanges are limited or unaffordable, and/or the 
cost containment measures and pilot programs that the ACA requires, may offset these benefits.  A 
negative impact to the hospital industry overall will likely result from scheduled cumulative reductions in 
Medicare payments; such reductions are substantial.  The ACA’s cost-cutting provisions to the Medicare 
program include reduction in Medicare market basket updates to hospital reimbursement rates under the 
inpatient prospective payment system, additional reductions to or elimination of Medicare reimbursement 
for certain patient readmissions and hospital-acquired conditions, as well as anticipated reductions in rates 
paid to Medicare managed care plans that may ultimately be passed on to providers.  Industry experts also 
expect that government cost reduction actions may be followed by private insurers and other third-party 
payors.
</p>
<p>Health care providers could be further subjected to decreased reimbursement as a result of 
implementation of recommendations of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (“IPAB”).  In the event 
that the projected Medicare per capita growth rate exceeds a target growth rate in any year, IPAB is 
directed to make recommendations for cost reduction, and those recommended reductions will be 
automatically implemented unless Congress adopts alternative legislation that meets equivalent savings 
targets.  While hospitals are largely exempted from recommendations from the IPAB, industry experts 
also expect that government cost reduction actions may be followed by private insurers and payors.  As of 
the date of this Official Statement, IPAB members have not been appointed by the President. 
</p>
<p>Beginning in 2014, the ACA created state “health insurance exchanges” in which health 
insurance can be purchased by certain groups and segments of the population, expanded the availability of 
subsidies and tax credits for premium payments by some consumers and employers, and required that 
certain terms and conditions be included by commercial insurers in contracts with providers.  In addition, 
the ACA imposed many new obligations on states related to health insurance.  It is unclear how the 
increased federal oversight of state health care may affect future state oversight or affect the Corporation.  
The health insurance exchanges may have a positive impact for hospitals by increasing the availability of 
health insurance to individuals who were previously uninsured.  Conversely, employers or individuals 
may shift their purchase of health insurance to new plans offered through the exchanges, which may or </p>

Beginning in 2014, the ACA created state “health insurance exchanges” in which health
insurance can be purchased by certain groups and segments of the population, expanded the availability of
subsidies and tax credits for premium payments by some consumers and employers, and required that
certain terms and conditions be included by commercial insurers in contracts with providers. In addition,
the ACA imposed many new obligations on states related to health insurance. It is unclear how the
increased federal oversight of state health care may affect future state oversight or affect the Corporation.
The health insurance exchanges may have a positive impact for hospitals by increasing the availability of
health insurance to individuals who were previously uninsured. Conversely, employers or individuals
may shift their purchase of health insurance to new plans offered through the exchanges, which may or

</div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  25 
</p>
<p>may not reimburse providers at rates equivalent to rates the providers currently receive.  The exchanges 
could alter the health insurance markets in ways that cannot be predicted, and exchanges might, directly 
or indirectly, take on a rate-setting function that could negatively impact providers.  Because the 
exchanges are still relatively new, the effects of these changes upon the financial condition of any third 
party payor that offers health insurance, rates paid by third-party payors to providers and, thus, the 
revenues of the Corporation, and upon the operations, results of operations and financial condition of the 
Corporation, taken as a whole, cannot be predicted. 
</p>
<p>The ACA will likely affect some health care organizations differently from others, depending, in 
part, on how each organization adapts to the legislation’s emphasis on directing more federal health care 
dollars to integrated provider organizations and providers with demonstrable achievements in quality 
care.  The ACA has created a value-based purchasing system for hospitals under which a percentage of 
payments will be contingent on satisfaction of specified performance measures related to common and 
high-cost medical conditions, such as cardiac, surgical and pneumonia care.  The ACA also funds various 
demonstration programs and pilot projects and other voluntary programs to evaluate and encourage new 
provider delivery models and payment structures, including “accountable care organizations” and bundled 
provider payments.  The outcomes of these projects and programs, including the likelihood of being made 
permanent or expanded or their effect on health care organizations’ revenues or financial performance 
cannot be predicted. 
</p>
<p>The ACA has expanded access to Medicaid and the scope of services covered thereunder.  With 
respect to access, Medicaid may be available to all individuals with incomes of less than 138% of the 
federal poverty level, depending on whether a state opts to expand such coverage.  The ACA allows 
states, beginning in 2014, to expand Medicaid eligibility to non-elderly, non-pregnant individuals who are 
not otherwise eligible for Medicare, if they have incomes of less than 138% of the federal poverty level.  
To assist states with the cost of covering such newly eligible individuals, the federal government has paid 
100% of the new cost for a limited number of years.  Thereafter, the cost share is expected to decrease to 
90%.  However, the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. 
Sebelius (2012) made expansion of Medicaid an option for each state.  In the event a state chooses not to 
participate in the expanded Medicaid program, the net effect of the reforms in the ACA could be 
significantly reduced.  Additionally, Medicaid reimbursement rates differ by state and the effect of 
expanded Medicaid enrollment must be determined on a state-by-state basis. 
</p>
<p>The ACA contains amendments to existing criminal, civil and administrative anti-fraud statutes 
and increases in funding for enforcement and efforts to recoup prior federal health care payments to 
providers.  Under the ACA, a broad range of providers, suppliers and physicians are required to adopt a 
compliance and ethics program.  While the government has already increased its enforcement efforts, 
failure to implement certain core compliance program features provides new opportunities for regulatory 
and enforcement scrutiny, as well as potential liability if an organization fails to prevent or identify 
improper federal health care program claims and payments.  See also “—Regulatory Environment” 
below.
</p>
<p>With respect to charity care, the ACA contains many features from previous tax exempt reform 
proposals, including a set of sweeping changes applicable to charitable hospitals exempt under 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.  The ACA: (i) imposes new eligibility requirements for 501(c)(3) 
hospitals, coupled with an excise tax for failures to meet certain of those requirements; (ii) requires 
mandatory IRS review of the hospitals’ entitlement to exemption; (iii) sets forth new reporting 
requirements, including information related to community health needs assessments and audited financial 
statements; (iv) requires hospitals to adopt and publicize a financial assistance policy, limit charges to 
patients who qualify for financial assistance to the amounts generally billed to insured patients and 
prohibits the use of gross charges, and control the billing and collection processes; and (v) imposes </p>

<p>Efforts to repeal or substantially modify provisions of the ACA are from time to time pending in 
Congress.  In June 2012, the Supreme Court upheld most provisions of the ACA, while limiting the 
power of the federal government to penalize states for refusing to expand Medicaid, and in June 2015, the 
Supreme Court issued a decision in King v. Burwell, ruling that health insurance subsidies under the ACA 
would be available in all states, including those with a federally-facilitated health insurance exchange.  In 
November 2015, the BBA repealed a provision of the ACA which would require employers that offer one 
or more health benefits plans and have more than 200 full-time employees to automatically enroll new 
full-time employees in a health plan. 
</p>
<p>On January 30, 2017, President Trump issued an executive order requiring federal agencies to 
remove two previously implemented regulations for every new regulation added. President Trump also 
issued an executive order directing each federal agency to set up a “regulatory reform task force” to 
review existing regulations and eliminate those which are costly or unnecessary. Based on these executive 
orders and the present political climate, there can be no assurances that-any existing health care laws and 
regulations will remain in their current form. Further, there can be no assurances that any potential 
changes to the laws and regulations governing health care would not have a material adverse financial or 
operational impact on the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>In May 2017 the U.S. House of Representatives voted to adopt the American Health Care Act 
(the “AHCA”), which would replace portions of the ACA, including eliminating the individual and large 
employer mandate to obtain or provide health insurance coverage, respectively, imposing a per capita cap 
on federal funding of Medicaid programs, or permitting the transition of federal funding to block grants, 
and permitting states to seek waivers of certain federal essential health benefit and pre-existing condition 
requirements.  In June 2017, the U.S. Senate proposed a corresponding bill containing substantially 
similar provisions as described above with respect to the AHCA but with other slight variations from the 
bill approved by the House of Representatives.   
</p>
<p>There can be no assurance that the provisions in the proposed legislation will be adopted as 
proposed. If the provisions of the proposed legislation are implemented in their current form or otherwise, 
there can be no assurance that any such legislation will not materially adversely affect the Corporation. 
Also, there can be no assurances that any current health care laws and regulations, in addition to the ACA,

<p>California Health Care Reform.  The State has enacted several laws intended to implement the 
ACA within the required federal timeframes.  Among the steps taken to date to implement or advance the 
ACA, the State established a state health insurance exchange which operates under a brand name, 
“Covered California”; the State approved expansion of Medi-Cal coverage, effective January 1, 2014, to 
include adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level who are under age 65, not pregnant 
and not otherwise currently eligible for Medi-Cal; and legislation was enacted prohibiting insurers from 
denying health coverage based on preexisting conditions.  In addition, the State is also running a dual-
eligibles pilot program with federal funding.  The implementation of health care reform has extended 
coverage under Medi-Cal to approximately four million more Californians in three years and added new 
services such as treatment for substance abuse and mental health. </p>

</p>
<p>Covered California launched its insurance website and enrollment websites on time.  Its launch 
issues were reportedly minor in comparison to the significant challenges of other state exchanges.  A 
significant issue faced by Covered California is a byproduct of delays in enrollment eligibility 
determinations for Medi-Cal. 
</p>
<p>Patient Service Revenues 
</p>
<p>The Medicare and Medicaid Programs.  The Corporation is certified to receive payment from 
both the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  The Medicare program provides certain health care benefits 
to beneficiaries who are 65 years of age or older or disabled, or qualify for the End Stage Renal Disease 
Program.  Although the Corporation is a participating provider in the Medicare program, for the fiscal 
year ended August 31, 2016, less than 1% of gross patient service revenues were derived from Medicare 
reimbursement.  The Medicaid program provides medical assistance for certain needy individuals and 
their dependents.  The federal and state governments jointly fund the Medicaid program, with limited 
funds coming from the federal government so long as the Medicaid program meets federal standards.  For 
information regarding Medicaid payments received by the Corporation for the fiscal year ended 
August 31, 2016, see APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION CONCERNING LUCILE SALTER 
PACKARD CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AT STANFORD—OPERATING AND FINANCIAL 
INFORMATION—Sources of Patient Service Revenue.” 
</p>
<p>Attempts to balance or reduce the federal budget, along with balanced-budget requirements in the 
State, will likely negatively impact Medicaid funding.  Payments made to health care providers under the 
Medicaid program are subject to change as a result of federal or state legislative and administrative 
actions, including changes in the methods for calculating payments, the amount of payments that will be 
made for covered services, the eligibility requirements for Medicaid coverage, and the types of services 
that will be covered under the program.  Such changes have occurred in the past and may be expected to 
occur in the future, particularly in response to federal and state budgetary constraints and increased fiscal 
pressure on the Medicaid program in periods of high unemployment.  Reduction in the level of Medicaid 
spending or a reduction in Medicaid provider reimbursement rates may have an adverse impact on the 
revenues of the Corporation derived from the Medicaid program.  Reduction in coverage of persons under 
Medicaid, by changes in the poverty level threshold required for eligibility or otherwise, to eliminate 
groups of currently eligible California residents, could increase the number of uninsured persons treated 
by health care providers and increase the risk of unreimbursed expenses.
</p>
<p>Risks related to the Medicare program are only briefly summarized herein due to the limited 
amount of revenues of the Corporation derived from Medicare. 
</p>
<p>Medicare Program.  Medicare is of limited relevance to children’s hospitals since it provides 
reimbursement only for children with end stage renal disease and certain others qualified for 
Supplemental Security Income disability.  Children’s hospitals are also expressly excluded from the 
Medicare prospective payment system of reimbursement and continue to receive Medicare reimbursement 
for inpatient hospital services on a reasonable cost basis. 
</p>
<p>Medicaid Program.  Medicaid is a program of medical assistance, funded jointly by the federal 
government and the states, for certain low income individuals and their dependents.  Under Medicaid, the 
federal government provides limited funding to states that have medical assistance programs that meet 
federal standards.  The ACA provides significantly enhanced federal funding for states to expand their 
Medicaid program to virtually all non-elderly, non-disabled adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal 
poverty level.  Attempts to balance or reduce the federal and state budgets, including the balanced budget 
requirements in California, may negatively impact spending for Medicaid and other state health care 
programs spending. </p>

determinations for Medi-Cal.

Patient Service Revenues

The Medicare and Medicaid Programs. The Corporation is certified to receive payment from
both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Medicare program provides certain health care benefits
to beneficiaries who are 65 years of age or older or disabled, or qualify for the End Stage Renal Disease
Program. Although the Corporation is a participating provider in the Medicare program, for the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2016, less than 1% of gross patient service revenues were derived from Medicare
reimbursement. The Medicaid program provides medical assistance for certain needy individuals and
their dependents. The federal and state governments jointly fund the Medicaid program, with limited
funds coming from the federal government so long as the Medicaid program meets federal standards. For
information regarding Medicaid payments received by the Corporation for the fiscal year ended
August 31, 2016, see APPENDIX A -— “INFORMATION CONCERNING LUCILE SALTER
PACKARD CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AT STANFORD—OPERATING AND FINANCIAL
INFORMATION—Sources of Patient Service Revenue.”

Attempts to balance or reduce the federal budget, along with balanced-budget requirements in the
State, will likely negatively impact Medicaid funding. Payments made to health care providers under the
Medicaid program are subject to change as a result of federal or state legislative and administrative
actions, including changes in the methods for calculating payments, the amount of payments that will be
made for covered services, the eligibility requirements for Medicaid coverage, and the types of services
that will be covered under the program. Such changes have occurred in the past and may be expected to
occur in the future, particularly in response to federal and state budgetary constraints and increased fiscal
pressure on the Medicaid program in periods of high unemployment. Reduction in the level of Medicaid
spending or a reduction in Medicaid provider reimbursement rates may have an adverse impact on the
revenues of the Corporation derived from the Medicaid program. Reduction in coverage of persons under
Medicaid, by changes in the poverty level threshold required for eligibility or otherwise, to eliminate
groups of currently eligible California residents, could increase the number of uninsured persons treated
by health care providers and increase the risk of unreimbursed expenses.

Risks related to the Medicare program are only briefly summarized herein due to the limited
amount of revenues of the Corporation derived from Medicare.

Medicare Program. Medicare is of limited relevance to children’s hospitals since it provides
reimbursement only for children with end stage renal disease and certain others qualified for
Supplemental Security Income disability. Children’s hospitals are also expressly excluded from the
Medicare prospective payment system of reimbursement and continue to receive Medicare reimbursement
for inpatient hospital services on a reasonable cost basis.

Medicaid Program. Medicaid is a program of medical assistance, funded jointly by the federal
government and the states, for certain low income individuals and their dependents. Under Medicaid, the
federal government provides limited funding to states that have medical assistance programs that meet
federal standards. The ACA provides significantly enhanced federal funding for states to expand their
Medicaid program to virtually all non-elderly, non-disabled adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal
poverty level. Attempts to balance or reduce the federal and state budgets, including the balanced budget
requirements in California, may negatively impact spending for Medicaid and other state health care
programs spending.

</p>
<p>Medi-Cal Program.  Medi-Cal is the California Medicaid program.  A significant portion of the 
Corporation’s revenues is derived from the Medi-Cal program.  As a result, changes in the Medi-Cal 
program could materially and adversely affect the financial condition of the Corporation and, therefore, 
adversely affect the ability of the Corporation to make Loan Repayments. 
</p>
<p>Effective July 1, 2013, the State adopted a payment methodology based on All-Patient Refined 
Diagnosis Related Groups (“APR-DRGs”) to reimburse acute care hospitals.  The APR-DRG payment 
method was phased in over a three-year period and uses a proprietary classification system for clinical 
conditions that is currently licensed and in use by many other state Medicaid programs.  Under the APR-
DRG payment methodology, the State Department of Health Care Services (“DHCS”) reimburses 
hospitals a fixed amount for each inpatient admission based on the APR-DRG for that admission, which 
DHCS will assign based on the diagnoses, procedures, patient age and discharge status submitted on the 
hospital claim form. As DHCS and hospitals gain experience with the APR-DRG payment methodology, 
DHCS intends to make adjustments in certain circumstances.  It is anticipated that some California 
hospitals will see decreases in Medi-Cal payments while other hospitals will receive increases.  
Management does not believe that these changes have had any material impact on the financial condition 
of the Corporation, but cannot predict the effect of any future changes to the payment method on the 
financial condition of the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>At this time, a significant amount of legislation regarding Medi-Cal has been proposed.  At this 
time, management is unable to determine the impact that any current or future proposed legislation, if 
enacted, may have on the financial condition of the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Impact of Medicaid Payment Reductions.  The ACA made changes to Medicaid funding and 
substantially increased the potential number of Medicaid beneficiaries.  To fund this expansion, the ACA 
provided that the federal government will fund 100% of the costs of this expansion from fiscal years 
2014-2016, decreasing to 90% of the costs of this expansion in fiscal year 2020 and thereafter.  In June 
2012, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the federal government cannot withhold existing federal funds for 
states that refuse to expand Medicaid as required by the ACA.  The State expanded Medi-Cal under the 
ACA.  Historically Medi-Cal has reimbursed at rates below the cost of care.  Therefore, increases in the 
overall proportion of Medi-Cal patients pose a financial risk to the Corporation.  It is uncertain to what 
extent the risk of lower reimbursement rates under Medi-Cal may be mitigated if the increased Medi-Cal 
utilization replaces previously uncompensated patients.  Furthermore, there can be no assurance that 
legislation will not be adopted that would materially alter federal financing to the states in support of the 
Medicaid program, and there can be no assurance that any such legislation will not materially adversely 
affect the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, attempts to balance or reduce the federal budget, along with balanced-budget 
requirements in the State, will likely negatively impact Medicaid funding.  Payments made to health care 
providers are subject to change, including changes in the methods for calculating payments, the amount of 
payments and the types of services that will be covered.  Coverage of persons under Medicaid could also 
be reduced. 
</p>
<p>Medi-Cal Managed Care.  Under federal waivers, the State has implemented a plan to expand 
Medi-Cal managed care.  There are currently six basic types of Medi-Cal managed care programs 
operating in California: (1) Two-Plan Model; (2) County Organized Health System Model; (3) 
Geographic Managed Care Model; (4) Regional Expansion Model; (5) Imperial Model; and (6) San 
Benito (Voluntary) Model.  The latter three models were created when Medi-Cal began expanding 
managed care to rural areas beginning in late 2013.  The largest share of Medi-Cal beneficiaries are 
enrolled in the Two-Plan Model.  Under the Two-Plan Model, DHCS contracts with two managed care 
plans in a given county, one “Local Initiative” and one commercial HMO plan, for the care of enrolled </p>

of the Corporation, but cannot predict the effect of any future changes to the payment method on the
financial condition of the Corporation.

At this time, a significant amount of legislation regarding Medi-Cal has been proposed. At this
time, management is unable to determine the impact that any current or future proposed legislation, if

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  29 
</p>
<p>Medi-Cal beneficiaries on a capitated basis.  The Corporation’s primary service area includes San Mateo 
and Santa Clara counties.  San Mateo County operates as a county-organized health system.  Santa Clara 
County uses the two-plan model, pursuant to which one plan, the “Local Initiative,” is run by a public 
board established by the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors and the second plan is a commercial 
HMO plan operated by Blue Cross.  In each instance, the Corporation negotiates reimbursement rates 
directly with the applicable Medi-Cal managed care plan. 
</p>
<p>California Hospital Provider Fee Program.  In 2009, the State legislature enacted State 
Assembly Bill 1383, which created the Hospital Fee Program and Hospital Quality Assurance Fee 
Program (collectively, the “Provider Fee Program”) and imposed a “quality assurance fee” (“QAF”) on 
certain California general acute care hospitals, except for public hospitals and certain exempt hospitals.  
The QAF is essentially a tax on hospitals to raise funds for provider payments.  The proceeds are used to 
earn federal matching funds for Medi-Cal, and to increase Medi-Cal payments to hospitals.  Under this 
program, some California hospitals receive more funding in increased Medi-Cal reimbursement than the 
quality assurance fees paid, while other California hospitals receive less money in Medi-Cal payments 
than the fees paid.  In 2013, the State legislature enacted the Medi-Cal Hospital Reimbursement 
Improvement Act of 2013, which established the fourth QAF program for hospitals in California, 
covering calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016.  The current QAF program operates on the same terms as 
the prior program.  The fee-for-service segment of this program was approved by CMS in 
December 2014.  The managed care segment was partially approved by CMS in June 2015.  The 
California Medi-Cal Hospital Reimbursement Initiative, or Proposition 52, which passed in 
November 2016, will extend the hospital fee program indefinitely, subject to CMS approval, and put 
protections in place to prevent diversion of funds from the program.  See APPENDIX A – 
“INFORMATION CONCERNING LUCILE SALTER PACKARD CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AT 
STANFORD—OPERATING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Sources of Patient Service 
Revenue” for information concerning the impact of this program on the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Medicare and Medicaid Audits.  The Corporation, like other hospitals throughout the country, is 
subject from time to time to audits and other investigations relating to various aspects of its operations 
and billing practices.  Medicare and Medicaid participating hospitals are subject to audits and retroactive 
audit adjustments with respect to reimbursement claimed under these programs.  Medicare and Medicaid 
regulations also provide for withholding reimbursement payments in certain circumstances.  New billing 
systems, new medical procedures and procedures for which there is no clear guidance from CMS or the 
California Medical Assistance Commission may all result in potential liability.  The penalties for 
violations may include an obligation to refund money to the Medicare or Medicaid program, payment of 
criminal or civil fines and, for serious or repeated violations, exclusion from participation in federal 
health care programs. 
</p>
<p>Recovery Audit Contractor Program. CMS has implemented a Recovery Audit Contractor 
(“RAC”) program on a nationwide basis pursuant to which CMS contracts with private contractors to 
conduct pre- and post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service 
Medicare program.  The ACA expands the RAC program’s scope to include managed Medicare plans and 
Medicaid claims.  CMS also employs Medicaid Integrity Contractors to perform post-payment audits of 
Medicaid claims and identify improper payments.  These programs tend to result in retroactively reduced 
payment and higher administration costs to hospitals. 
</p>
<p>Medi-Cal for Families Program and Healthy Families Program.  The State administers Medi-
Cal’s Optional Targeted Low Income Children’s Program, known as the Medi-Cal for Families Program, 
which provides health, dental, mental health and substance abuse services to children whose families have 
incomes up to 250% of the federal poverty level. The Medi-Cal for Families Program is a successor to the 
California Healthy Families Program (the “Healthy Families Program”), a program administered by the </p>
<p/>
<div class="ocr">Medi-Cal beneficiaries on a capitated basis. The Corporation’s primary service area includes San Mateo
and Santa Clara counties. San Mateo County operates as a county-organized health system. Santa Clara
County uses the two-plan model, pursuant to which one plan, the “Local Initiative,” is run by a public

<p>Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board, which provided health care services to children of working 
parents who earned too much to qualify for Medi-Cal but who could not afford private health insurance.  
Eligible children were transitioned from the Healthy Families Program to the Medi-Cal for Families 
Program between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013.  The Corporation receives less than 1% of its 
gross patient service revenue from the Healthy Families Program and the Medi-Cal for Families Program. 
</p>
<p>CCS Program.  The California Children’s Services Program (the “CCS Program”) is a state 
program that provides case management, diagnosis and treatment services to children with severe 
qualifying medical conditions and whose families are unable to pay for all or part of the care required.  
The amount of State money available for the CCS program is determined annually through California’s 
budget process.  The CCS Program reimburses the Corporation on a fee-for-service basis.  The CCS 
patient revenue is included with the Medi-Cal program revenue for classification in APPENDIX A – 
“INFORMATION CONCERNING LUCILE SALTER PACKARD CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AT 
STANFORD—OPERATING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Sources of Patient Service 
Revenue”.
</p>
<p>Supplemental Medi-Cal Payments for Disproportionate Share Hospitals.  Medicaid 
disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) payments provide financial assistance to hospitals that serve a 
large number of low-income patients, including the uninsured and Medicaid beneficiaries.  The state and 
federal governments share the costs of the DSH program, with the federal government funding and 
distributing federal DSH payments, or allotments, to states based on a statutory formula.  Medicaid DSH 
payments have historically been the largest source of federal funding for uncompensated hospital care.  
States have discretion to determine how DSH payments are allocated among hospitals within their states.  
Under federal waivers, California has, since 2005, allocated its federal DSH allotment to public hospitals.  
However, private hospitals that meet the eligibility criteria for DSH receive an amount referred to as DSH 
replacement funding that is equivalent to the amount they would be entitled to in traditional DSH funding.  
Qualifying California private hospitals have historically received a total of approximately $465 million in 
DSH replacement payments annually. 
</p>
<p>In 2013, CMS issued a final rule confirming its methodology for statewide reductions in 
uninsured and uncompensated care, and reduced Medicaid DSH allotments to each state.  Under this final 
rule, the federal share of Medicaid DSH payments was reduced by $500 million in fiscal year 2014 and 
$600 million in fiscal year 2015.  Such reductions have been delayed several times, most recently under 
the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), but are scheduled to take 
effect October 1, 2018, which extended cuts through fiscal year 2025.  The DSH replacement program’s 
funding level is currently linked to California’s federal DSH allotment.  It cannot be assured that the level 
and timing of health insurance coverage gains will reduce hospital uncompensated care costs so as to fully 
offset these authorized reductions to federal DSH funding.  Nor can there be any assurance that DSH 
funding will not be further decreased beyond projected reductions or eliminated entirely. 
</p>
<p>The Corporation serves a number of low income and Medi-Cal eligible individuals and from time 
to time has qualified for DSH replacement funding.  See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION 
CONCERNING LUCILE SALTER PACKARD CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AT STANFORD—
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Sources of Patient Service Revenue.” 
</p>
<p>California State Budget.  The State enacted a balanced fiscal year 2017-18 budget which took 
effect on July 1, 2017.  However, it is impossible to predict the impact of future financial challenges to 
the California economy, including threat of future recessions, changes in federal spending policy and 
other events that could result in budget deficits.  It is also impossible to predict actions that the Governor, 
the State legislature or voters—via ballot initiative—may take in the future.  It is reasonable to expect,

California State Budget. The State enacted a balanced fiscal year 2017-18 budget which took
effect on July 1, 2017. However, it is impossible to predict the impact of future financial challenges to
the California economy, including threat of future recessions, changes in federal spending policy and

</div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  31 
</p>
<p>spending, will be pursued to keep the State’s budget in balance, which may have an adverse effect on the 
financial condition of the Corporation.  Examples of past such actions are set forth below: 
</p>
<p>• Aggressive health care cost-containment efforts by the Governor and the State legislature 
to help eliminate prior years’ budget deficits, including the State’s substantial cuts to 
health care provider reimbursement, including Medi-Cal payments to hospitals.  For 
example, California enacted legislation to reduce its Medicaid expenditures through 
eligibility restrictions (causing a greater number of indigent, uninsured or underinsured 
patients), and reductions in Medicaid payment rates.  In October 2011, CMS approved 
the State’s request for 10% reductions in Medi-Cal payments for certain outpatient 
services and for long-term care.  In May 2013, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld 
the reductions, and in January 2014, the Supreme Court declined to review. 
</p>
<p>• The significant expansions to Medicaid programs – Medi-Cal in California – under the 
ACA will require additional program funding.  Federal funding is available for some of 
this expansion, but it is conditioned on states maintaining specified beneficiary eligibility 
criteria and California has sought to limit program eligibility in recent years to reduce 
program costs.  In May 2016, individuals 19 years of age and younger who meet income 
standards became eligible for full-scope Medi-Cal benefits regardless of immigration 
status.  This population was previously only eligible for restricted-scope Medi-Cal, which 
only covers emergency medical conditions.  This expansion will require additional 
program funding, with State funds for which federal participation may not be available. 
</p>
<p>• While federal funding is available to facilitate Medicaid program expansion, this funding 
is expected to be temporary.  The Medicaid program expansion and the expected longer-
term loss of federal financial support to offset longer-term expansion-related costs may 
require the State to reduce provider reimbursement rates further. 
</p>
<p>Health Plans and Managed Care.  Most private health insurance coverage is provided by various 
types of “managed care” plans, including health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and preferred 
provider organizations (“PPOs”) that generally use discounts and other economic incentives to reduce or 
limit the utilization of or payment for health care services.  Medicare and Medicaid also purchase health 
care using managed care options.  Payments to health care organizations from managed care plans 
typically are lower than those received from traditional indemnity or commercial insurers. 
</p>
<p>In California, managed care plans have replaced indemnity insurance as the primary source of 
non-governmental payment for hospital services.  Hospitals must be capable of attracting and maintaining 
managed care business, often on a regional basis.  Regional coverage and aggressive pricing may be 
required.  However, it is also essential that contracting hospitals be able to provide the contracted services 
without significant operating losses, which may require multiple forms of cost containment. 
</p>
<p>Many HMOs and PPOs currently pay providers on a negotiated fee-for-service basis or, for 
institutional care, on a fixed rate per day of care, or a fixed rate per hospital stay, which, in each case, 
usually is discounted from the usual and customary charges for the care provided.  As a result, the 
discounts offered to HMOs and PPOs could, in some cases, result in payment to a provider that is less 
than its actual cost.  Additionally, the volume of patients directed to a provider may vary significantly 
from projections, and/or changes in the utilization may be dramatic and unexpected, thus jeopardizing the 
provider’s ability to manage this component of revenue and cost. 
</p>
<p>Increasingly, payors are contracting with health care providers to reduce the growth of health care 
spending by moving away from fee-for-service payment systems toward value-based payment </p>

program funding, with State funds for which federal participation may not be available.

e While federal funding is available to facilitate Medicaid program expansion, this funding
is expected to be temporary. The Medicaid program expansion and the expected longer-
term loss of federal financial support to offset longer-term expansion-related costs may
require the State to reduce provider reimbursement rates further.

Health Plans and Managed Care. Most private health insurance coverage is provided by various
types of “managed care” plans, including health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and preferred
provider organizations (“PPOs”) that generally use discounts and other economic incentives to reduce or
limit the utilization of or payment for health care services. Medicare and Medicaid also purchase health
care using managed care options. Payments to health care organizations from managed care plans
typically are lower than those received from traditional indemnity or commercial insurers.

In California, managed care plans have replaced indemnity insurance as the primary source of
non-governmental payment for hospital services. Hospitals must be capable of attracting and maintaining
managed care business, often on a regional basis. Regional coverage and aggressive pricing may be
required. However, it is also essential that contracting hospitals be able to provide the contracted services
without significant operating losses, which may require multiple forms of cost containment.

Many HMOs and PPOs currently pay providers on a negotiated fee-for-service basis or, for
institutional care, on a fixed rate per day of care, or a fixed rate per hospital stay, which, in each case,
usually is discounted from the usual and customary charges for the care provided. As a result, the
discounts offered to HMOs and PPOs could, in some cases, result in payment to a provider that is less
than its actual cost. Additionally, the volume of patients directed to a provider may vary significantly
from projections, and/or changes in the utilization may be dramatic and unexpected, thus jeopardizing the
provider’s ability to manage this component of revenue and cost.

Increasingly, payors are contracting with health care providers to reduce the growth of health care
spending by moving away from fee-for-service payment systems toward value-based payment

<p>mechanisms that link reimbursement to clinical quality and management of the cost of care.  Value-based 
payment mechanisms include shared risk, shared savings, pay for performance, bundled pricing, episode 
treatment groups, and capitation.  These models are intended to reward providers for delivering high-
quality care in the most cost-appropriate setting, while holding providers financially accountable for care 
that is of poor quality or delivered in a high-cost setting. 
</p>
<p>Some HMOs employ a “capitation” payment method under which hospitals are paid a 
predetermined periodic rate for each enrollee in the HMO who is “assigned” or otherwise directed to 
receive care from a particular hospital.  The hospital may assume financial risk for the cost and scope of 
institutional care given.  If payment is insufficient to meet the hospital’s actual costs of care, or if 
utilization by such enrollees materially exceeds projections, the financial condition of the hospital could 
erode rapidly and significantly.  In addition to this standard managed care risk sharing approach, private 
health insurance companies are increasingly adopting various additional risk sharing/cost containing 
measures, sometimes similar to those introduced by government payors.  Providers may expect health 
care cost containment and its associated risk sharing to continue to increase in the coming years amongst 
all payors. 
</p>
<p>Often, managed care contracts are enforceable for a stated term, regardless of hospital losses and 
may require hospitals to care for enrollees for a certain time period, regardless of whether the payor is 
able to pay the hospital.  Hospitals from time to time have disputes with HMOs, PPOs and other managed 
care payors concerning payment and contract interpretation issues.  Such disputes may result in 
mediation, arbitration or litigation.

participation may result in lower net income if participating hospitals are unable to adequately contain 
their costs.  In part to reduce costs, health plans are increasingly implementing, and offering to purchasing 
employers, tiered provider networks, which involve classification of a plan’s network providers into 
different tiers based on care quality and cost.  With tiered benefit designs, plan enrollees are generally 
encouraged, through incentives or reductions in copayments or deductibles, to seek care from providers in 
the top tier.  Classification of a hospital in a non-preferred or lower tier by a significant payor may result 
in a material loss of volume.  The new demands of dominant health plans and other shifts in the managed

Managed care plans often look at quality performance and cost in selecting providers to participate in

convert ICD-10 claims into ICD-9 codes for calculating payments under Medicaid fee-for-service 
programs.  While this crosswalk approach creates risk of payment delays and potential errors, most

behalf of sponsors seeking FDA approval to market the drug or device that is the subject of the research.  
Moreover, the Office of Inspector General (the “OIG”) in its recent “Work Plans” has included several 
enforcement initiatives related to reimbursement for experimental drugs and devices (including kickback 
concerns) and has issued compliance program guidance directed at recipients of extramural research 
awards from the NIH and other agencies of the U.S. Public Health Service.  Although the Corporation is 
not the direct recipient of such awards (instead, Stanford University School of Medicine is the recipient of

False Claims Act. The federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) makes it illegal to knowingly submit or

present a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment or approval for payment for which the federal
government provides, or reimburses at least some portion of the requested money or property. Because

</p>
<p>the term “knowingly” is defined broadly under the law to include not only actual knowledge but also 
deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the facts, the FCA can be used to punish a wide range of 
conduct.  The ACA amends the FCA by expanding the number of activities that are subject to civil 
monetary penalties to include, among other things, failure to report and return known overpayments 
within statutory limits.  FCA investigations and cases have become common in the health care field and 
may cover a range of activity from submission of intentionally inflated billings, to highly technical billing 
infractions, to allegations of inadequate care.  Penalties under the FCA are severe and may include 
damages equal to three times the amount of the alleged false claims, as well as substantial civil monetary 
penalties.  As a result, violation or alleged violation of the FCA frequently results in settlements that 
require multi-million dollar payments and compliance agreements.  The FCA provides for potentially 
severe penalties: treble damages, attorneys’ fees and civil fines of $5,000 to $11,000 per claim.  In 
June 2016, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a rule that more than doubles civil monetary 
penalties under the FCA.  These increases took effect on August 1, 2016 and apply to FCA violations 
after November 2, 2015.  The new penalties significantly increase the potential financial exposure 
resulting from an FCA violation. 
</p>
<p>The FCA also permits individuals to initiate civil actions on behalf of the government in lawsuits 
called “qui tam” actions.  Qui tam plaintiffs, or “whistleblowers,” can share in the damages recovered by 
the federal government or recover independently if the government does not participate.  The FCA has 
become one of the federal government’s primary weapons against health care fraud and suspected fraud.  
FCA violations or alleged violations could lead to settlements, fines, exclusion or reputation damage that 
could have a material adverse impact on a hospital and other health care providers.  Some regulators and 
whistleblowers have asserted that claims submitted to governmental payers that do not comply fully with 
regulations or guidelines come within the scope of the FCA.  Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court in 
Universal Health Services, Inc. v. United States ex rel. Escobar held that the theory of “implied false 
certification” can be used as a basis for FCA liability when (1) a claim does more than merely request 
payment and makes specific representations about the nature of the goods or services provided and (2) the 
failure to disclose noncompliance with material statutory, regulatory or contractual provisions makes the 
representations “misleading half-truths.”  The application of this new standard is evolving and could lead 
to an increase in FCA claims in the health care industry based on this theory of liability. 
</p>
<p>Under the ACA, the FCA has been expanded to include overpayments that are discovered by a 
health care provider and are not promptly refunded to the applicable federal health care program, even if 
the claims relating to the overpayment were initially submitted without any knowledge that they were 
false.  The ACA requires that providers return identified overpayments within the later of 60 days of 
identification or the date any corresponding cost report is due or the overpayment becomes an 
“obligation” under the FCA.  There was initially great uncertainty in the industry as to when an 
overpayment is technically “identified” and the ability of a provider to determine the total amount of an 
overpayment and satisfy its repayment obligation within the required time period.  A March 14, 2016 
CMS final rule clarified that an overpayment is considered to have been identified when either reasonable 
diligence is completed (including determination of the overpayment amount) or on the day the person 
received credible information of a potential overpayment (if the person failed to conduct reasonable 
diligence and the person in fact received an overpayment).  That same final rule also established a six 
year lookback period, meaning overpayments must be reported and returned only if a person identifies the 
overpayment within six years of the date the overpayment was received.  This expansion of the FCA 
exposes hospitals and other health care providers to liability under the FCA for a considerably broader 
range of claims than in the past.

from soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly,
in cash or in kind, in return for a referral (or to induce a referral) for any item or service that is paid by

35
</div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  36 
</p>
<p>any federal or state health care program.  The Anti-Kickback Law potentially applies to many common 
health care transactions between persons and entities with which a hospital does business, including 
hospital-physician joint ventures, medical director agreements, physician recruitment agreements, 
physician office leases and other transactions.  The ACA amended the Anti-Kickback Law to provide 
explicitly that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law 
constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA.  Another amendment provides that an 
Anti-Kickback Law violation may be established without showing that an individual knew of the statute’s 
proscriptions or acted with specific intent to violate the Anti-Kickback Law, but only that the conduct was 
generally wrongful. 
</p>
<p>Violations or alleged violations of the Anti-Kickback Law may result in settlements that require 
multi-million dollar payments and onerous corporate integrity agreements.  The Anti-Kickback Law can 
be prosecuted either criminally or civilly.  A criminal violation may be prosecuted as a felony, subject to a 
fine of up to $25,000 for each act (which may be each item or each bill sent to a federal program), 
imprisonment and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, any of which could have a 
significant detrimental effect on the financial stability of most hospitals.  In addition, civil monetary 
penalties of $74,792 per item or service in noncompliance (which may be each item or each bill sent to a 
federal program) or an “assessment” of three times the amount claimed may be imposed.  Increasingly, 
the federal government and qui tam relators are prosecuting violations of the Anti-Kickback Law under 
the FCA, based on the argument that claims resulting from an illegal kickback arrangement are also false 
claims for FCA purposes.  See the discussion under the subheading “False Claims Act” above.  The IRS 
has taken the position that hospitals that are in violation of the Anti-Kickback Law may also be subject to 
revocation of their tax-exempt status.  See “—Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax Matters” below. 
</p>
<p>Stark Referral Law.  The federal “Stark” statute (“Stark” or the “Stark Law”) prohibits the 
referral of Medicare patients for certain designated health services (including inpatient and outpatient 
hospital services, clinical laboratory services, and radiation and other imaging services) to entities with 
which the referring physician, or immediate family member, has a financial relationship unless that 
relationship fits within a Stark exception.  It also prohibits a hospital furnishing the designated services 
from billing Medicare, or any other payor or individual for services performed pursuant to a prohibited 
referral.  The government does not need to prove that the entity knew that the referral was prohibited to 
establish a Stark violation.  If certain substantive and technical requirements of an applicable exception 
are not satisfied, many ordinary business practices and economically desirable arrangements between 
hospitals and physicians, which constitute “financial relationships” would fall within the meaning of the 
Stark statute, thus triggering the prohibition on referrals and billing.  Most providers of designated health 
services with physician relationships have some exposure to liability under the Stark statute. 
</p>
<p>Medicare may deny payment for all services performed based on a prohibited referral and a 
hospital that has billed for prohibited services may be obligated to notify and refund the amounts 
collected from the Medicare program.  For example, if an office lease between a hospital and a large 
group of heart surgeons is found to violate Stark, the hospital could be obligated to repay CMS for the 
payments received from Medicare for all of the heart surgeries performed by all of the physicians in the 
group for the duration of the lease; a potentially significant amount.  The government may also seek 
substantial civil monetary penalties, and in some cases, a hospital may be excluded from the Medicare 
and Medicaid programs.  Potential repayments to CMS, settlements, fines or exclusion for a Stark Law 
violation or alleged violation could have a material adverse impact on a hospital and other health care 
providers.  Increasingly, the federal government is prosecuting violations of the Stark Law under the 
FCA, based on the argument that claims resulting from an illegal referral arrangement are also false 
claims for FCA purposes.  See the discussion under the subheading “False Claims Act” above.  The 
federal government has attempted to recover the federal portion of Medicaid claims referred to hospitals 
by physicians with whom they have a prohibited financial relationship. </p>

</p>
<p>CMS has established a voluntary self-disclosure program under which hospitals and other entities 
may report Stark Law violations and seek a reduction in potential refund obligations.  The limited 
publicly available information with respect to the self-disclosure program suggests that most voluntary 
self-disclosure submissions remain under consideration by CMS for an extended period of time, and that 
it is difficult to predict how CMS will react to any specific voluntary self-disclosure.  The Corporation 
may make self-disclosures under this program as appropriate from time to time.  Any submission 
pursuant to the self-disclosure program does not waive or limit the ability of the OIG or DOJ to seek or 
prosecute violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute or impose civil monetary penalties. 
</p>
<p>State “Fraud” and “False Claims” Laws.  Hospital providers in California also are subject to a 
variety of State laws related to false claims (similar to the FCA or that are generally applicable false 
claims laws), anti-kickback (similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Law or that are generally applicable 
anti-kickback or fraud laws), and physician referral (similar to Stark).  These prohibitions while similar in 
public policy and scope to the federal laws have not in all instances been avidly enforced to date.  
However, in the future they could pose the possibility of material adverse impact for the same reasons as 
the federal statutes.  See discussion under the subheadings “False Claims Act,” “Anti-Kickback Law” and 
“Stark Referral Law” above.  California also has an FCA-type law that applies to fraudulent claims 
presented to an insurance company, which thus goes beyond the scope of the FCA and California’s 
directly analogous statute, which are limited to fraudulent claims for which the federal government is 
required to pay or reimburse a portion or all of the claim.  Under the California law, codified in 
Section 1871.7 of the California Insurance Code, a person who submits a fraudulent claim to an insurance 
company is subject to civil fines ranging from $5,000 to $10,000 per fraudulent claim, plus an additional 
assessment of no more than three times the amount of each claim, and may be subject to criminal 
penalties under the California Penal Code as well.  Similar to the FCA, actions under this Insurance Code 
section may be initiated by private parties. 
</p>
<p>Antitrust.  Antitrust liability may arise in a wide variety of circumstances, including medical staff 
privilege disputes, payor contracting, physician relations, joint ventures, merger, affiliation and 
acquisition activities, certain pricing or salary setting activities, as well as other areas of activity.  
Consolidation transactions among health care providers are an area in which investigation and 
enforcement activity by federal and state antitrust agencies is particularly frequent and vigorous.  The 
application of the federal and state antitrust laws to health care is evolving (especially as the ACA is 
implemented), and therefore not always clear.  Currently, the most common areas of potential liability are 
joint action among providers with respect to payor contracting and medical staff credentialing disputes, 
and hospital mergers and acquisitions. 
</p>
<p>Violation of the antitrust laws could result in criminal and/or civil enforcement proceedings by 
federal and state agencies, as well as actions by private litigants.  In certain actions, private litigants may 
be entitled to treble damages, and in others, governmental entities may be able to assess substantial 
monetary fines.  Investigations and proceedings arising from the application of federal and state antitrust 
laws can require the dedication of substantial resources by affected providers and can delay or impede 
proposed transactions even if ultimately it is determined that no violation of applicable law would occur 
as a result of the proposed transaction.

<p>HIPAA, HITECH, and Other Privacy and Security Requirements.  HIPAA, along with other 
federal and various state statutes, addresses the confidentiality of individuals’ health information.  
HIPAA’s detailed privacy standards extend not only to patient medical records, but also to a variety of 
demographic, clinical and financial information held by “covered entities,” i.e. hospitals and other entities 
governed by HIPAA.  HIPAA’s privacy standards prohibit the use and disclosure of, and access to, 
“Protected Health Information” (“PHI”), a broadly defined term, unless expressly permitted under the 
provisions of the HIPAA statute and regulations or authorized by the patient.  The HIPAA privacy </p>

HIPAA, HITECH, and Other Privacy and Security Requirements. HIPAA, along with other
federal and various state statutes, addresses the confidentiality of individuals’ health information.
HIPAA’s detailed privacy standards extend not only to patient medical records, but also to a variety of
demographic, clinical and financial information held by “covered entities,” i.e. hospitals and other entities
governed by HIPAA. HIPAA’s privacy standards prohibit the use and disclosure of, and access to,
“Protected Health Information” (“PHI’’), a broadly defined term, unless expressly permitted under the
provisions of the HIPAA statute and regulations or authorized by the patient. The HIPAA privacy

37
</div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  38 
</p>
<p>standards also give individuals the rights to know how their PHI is being used or disclosed, to access and 
amend their PHI, and obtain information about certain disclosures of their PHI.  They also obligate 
covered entities to provide Notices of Privacy Practices to individuals, which detail how the entities use 
and disclose PHI and how individuals can exercise their rights in respect of their PHI.  These 
requirements often impose communication, operational, and accounting obligations that add costs and 
create potentially unanticipated sources of liability. 
</p>
<p>HIPAA contains security standards that require covered entities to implement certain 
administrative, physical, and technical security standards to protect the integrity, confidentiality and 
availability of electronic PHI.  HIPAA also implemented transaction standards that dictate the use of 
standard transaction formats, code sets and standard identifiers in connection with certain electronic 
health care transactions between health plans and health care providers, including activities associated 
with the billing and collection of health care claims. 
</p>
<p>HIPAA imposes civil monetary penalties for violations and criminal penalties for violations of its 
privacy and security standards, and these civil penalties have now been increased through provisions  in 
the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”), which 
was enacted as part of the economic stimulus legislation.  The revised civil monetary penalty provisions 
of HITECH establish a tiered system of minimum penalties, ranging from a minimum of $110 per 
violation for an unknowing violation to a minimum of $55,010 for an uncorrected violation due to willful 
neglect.  Maximum penalties may reach $1,650,300 for identical violations. 
</p>
<p>The HITECH Act also (i) granted enforcement authority of HIPAA to state attorneys general, 
(ii) extended the reach of HIPAA beyond “covered entities,” (iii) imposed a breach notification 
requirement on HIPAA covered entities, (iv) limited certain uses and disclosures of PHI, and 
(v) restricted covered entities’ permissible marketing communications. 
</p>
<p>The breach notification obligation, in particular, may expose covered entities such as hospitals to 
heightened liability.  Under HITECH, in the event of a privacy breach, covered entities are required to 
notify affected individuals and the federal government.  If more than 500 individuals are affected by the 
breach, (1) the covered entity must also notify the media and (2) the federal government posts a 
description of the breach on its website and investigates the incident through the DHHS Office for Civil 
Rights, the administrative office that is tasked with enforcing HIPAA.  The Office for Civil Rights may 
also investigate breaches involving fewer than 500 affected individuals. 
</p>
<p>Recent settlements of HIPAA breaches have reached the millions of dollars.  Any breach of 
HIPAA, regardless of intent or scope, may result in penalties or settlement amounts that are material to a 
covered health care provider or health plan.  In addition to the costs associated with any such penalties 
and settlements, covered entities may incur significant costs associated with investigating and handling 
potential privacy and security breaches. 
</p>
<p>Enforcement activity is expected to increase in future years in other respects as well.  Criminal 
penalties may be enforced against persons who obtain or disclose personal health information without 
authorization.  DHHS is also beginning to perform periodic audits of health care providers and group 
health plans to ensure that required policies under the HITECH Act are in place. 
</p>
<p>On January 25, 2013, DHHS issued comprehensive modifications to the existing HIPAA 
regulations to implement the requirements of the HITECH Act, commonly known as the “HIPAA 
Omnibus Rule.”  The HIPAA Omnibus Rule became effective on March 26, 2013, and covered entities 
were required to be in compliance by September 23, 2013, although certain requirements have a longer 
timeframe.  Key aspects of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, some of which are discussed above in the </p>

(ii) extended the reach of HIPAA beyond “covered entities,” (iii) imposed a breach notification
requirement on HIPAA covered entities, (iv) limited certain uses and disclosures of PHI, and
(v) restricted covered entities’ permissible marketing communications.

The breach notification obligation, in particular, may expose covered entities such as hospitals to
heightened liability. Under HITECH, in the event of a privacy breach, covered entities are required to
notify affected individuals and the federal government. If more than 500 individuals are affected by the

38
</div>

<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  39 
</p>
<p>paragraphs discussing the HITECH Act, include, but are not limited to: (i) a new standard for what 
constitutes a breach of PHI, (ii) four levels of culpability with respect to civil monetary penalties assessed 
for HIPAA violations, (iii) direct liability of business associates for certain violations of HIPAA, 
(iv) modifications to the rules governing research, (v) stricter requirements regarding non-exempt 
marketing practices, (vi) modification and re-distribution of notices of privacy practices, (vii) expanded 
rights of individuals to receive electronic copies of their PHI, and (viii) stricter requirements regarding the 
protection of genetic information.  While the effects of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule cannot be predicted at 
this time, the obligations imposed thereunder could have a material adverse effect on the financial 
condition of the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Under HIPAA, covered entities must include certain required provisions in their contractual 
relationships with their business associates.  Business associates are organizations that perform functions 
on behalf of covered entities, and receive PHI from the covered entities in order to carry out those 
functions.  Business associates are indirectly regulated by HIPAA through those contractual obligations.  
The HITECH Act and the final rules promulgated thereunder provide that all of the HIPAA security 
administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, as well as security policy, procedure and 
documentation requirements, now apply directly to all business associates.  In addition, the HITECH Act 
makes certain privacy provisions directly applicable to business associates.  These changes are significant 
because business associates will now be directly regulated by DHHS for those requirements, and as a 
result, will be subject to penalties imposed by DHHS and/or state attorneys general.  Likewise, a covered 
entity may in certain circumstances be held liable for a breach by its business associate.  Covered entities 
have had to review and amend their business associate agreements in recent years in order to comply with 
these changing rules, which can be costly and administratively burdensome. 
</p>
<p>In addition to HIPAA and HITECH, a number of other laws address the confidentiality of 
individual health information.  These other laws may impose more stringent privacy requirements than 
HIPAA does.  For instance, federal laws place additional confidentiality requirements on records 
pertaining to alcohol and substance abuse treatment at certain facilities.  California and other states have 
adopted laws that afford greater protection to certain types of particularly sensitive health information, 
such as behavioral health records.  California and many other states have also adopted broad data breach 
notification laws that extend to compromised medical and health insurance information.  Together, all of 
these laws and regulations add compliance costs and create potentially unanticipated sources of legal 
liability for the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Electronic Health Record Requirements.  The HITECH Act also established programs under 
Medicare and Medicaid to provide incentive payments for the “meaningful use” of certified electronic 
health record (“EHR”) technology.  In 2011, the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs began 
providing incentive payments to eligible professionals and eligible hospitals for demonstrating 
meaningful use of certified EHR technology.  Health care providers demonstrate their meaningful use of 
EHR technology by meeting objectives specified by CMS for using health information technology and by 
reporting on specified clinical quality measures.  Beginning in 2015, hospitals and physicians that have 
not satisfied the performance and reporting criteria for demonstrating meaningful use will have their 
Medicare payments significantly reduced.  Additionally, beginning in 2014, the federal government began 
auditing hospitals’ and providers’ records related to their attestation of being “meaningful users” in order 
to obtain the incentive payments.  A hospital or provider that fails the audit will have an opportunity to 
appeal.  Ultimately, hospitals or providers that fail on appeal will have to repay any incentive payments 
they received through these programs.

<p>Security Breaches and Unauthorized Releases of Personal Information.  State and local 
authorities are increasingly focused on the importance of protecting the confidentiality of individuals’

Security Breaches and Unauthorized Releases of Personal Information. State and local

authorities are increasingly focused on the importance of protecting the confidentiality of individuals’
personal information, including patient health information. Many states, including California, have

39
</div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  40 
</p>
<p>enacted laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches that result in the unauthorized 
release of personal information.  In some states, notification requirements may be triggered even where 
information has not been used or disclosed, but rather has been inappropriately accessed. 
</p>
<p>California medical privacy laws penalize the unlawful use or disclosure of, patients’ medical 
information, as well as unauthorized access to such information, which the laws define as the 
inappropriate access, review, or viewing of patient medical information without the direct need to do so 
for purposes of diagnosis, treatment or other lawful use.  Administrative penalties under these medical 
privacy laws may reach $250,000 per violation or for each reported event. 
</p>
<p>State consumer protection laws may also provide the basis for legal action for privacy and 
security breaches and frequently, unlike HIPAA, authorize a private right of action.  In particular, the 
public nature of security incidents exposes health organizations to increased risk of individual or class 
action lawsuits from patients or other affected persons, in addition to government enforcement and 
negative media attention.  Failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy or to maintain robust

sensitive patient information maintain the confidentiality of such information, could consequently damage 
a hospital’s reputation and materially adversely affect business operations. 
</p>
<p>In any hospital, there can be security incidents related to patient information, which stem from a 
variety of causes ranging from external or internal deliberate invasions by individuals or employees, to 
inadvertent loss or misdirection of paper or electronic records, to theft of hardware or software. 
</p>
<p>Exclusions from Medicare or Medicaid Participation.  The government may exclude a hospital 
from Medicare/Medicaid program participation if it is convicted of a criminal offense relating to the 
delivery of any item or service reimbursed under Medicare or a state health care program, any criminal 
offense relating to patient neglect or abuse in connection with the delivery of health care, fraud against 
any federal, state or locally financed health care program or an offense relating to the illegal manufacture, 
distribution, prescription, or dispensing of a controlled substance.  The government also may exclude 
individuals or entities under certain other circumstances, such as an unrelated conviction of fraud, or other 
financial misconduct relating either to the delivery of health care in general or to participation in a federal, 
state or local government program.  Exclusion from the Medicare/Medicaid program means that a 
hospital would be decertified from program participation and no program payments can be made.  Any 
hospital exclusion could be a materially adverse event.  In addition, exclusion of hospital or independent 
contractors or their employees under Medicare or Medicaid may be another source of potential liability 
for hospitals or health systems based on services provided by those excluded employees. 
</p>
<p>Administrative Enforcement.  Administrative regulations may require less proof of a violation 
than do criminal laws, and, thus, health care providers may have a higher risk of imposition of monetary 
penalties as a result of administrative enforcement actions. 
</p>
<p>Civil Monetary Penalty Law.  The federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law (“CMPL”) provides for 
administrative sanctions against health care providers for a broad range of billing and other abuses.  A 
health care provider is liable under the CMPL if it knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, 
improper claims for reimbursement under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs.  A 
hospital that participates in arrangements known as “gainsharing” by paying a physician to limit or reduce 
services to Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries also could be subject to CMPL penalties.  A health care 
provider that provides benefits to Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries that such provider knows or should 
know are likely to induce the beneficiaries to choose the provider for their care also could be subject to 
CMPL penalties.  The CMPL authorizes imposition of a civil money penalty and treble damages.  The

<div class="ocr">enacted laws requiring businesses to notify individuals of security breaches that result in the unauthorized
release of personal information. In some states, notification requirements may be triggered even where
information has not been used or disclosed, but rather has been inappropriately accessed.

California medical privacy laws penalize the unlawful use or disclosure of, patients’ medical
information, as well as unauthorized access to such information, which the laws define as the
inappropriate access, review, or viewing of patient medical information without the direct need to do so
for purposes of diagnosis, treatment or other lawful use. Administrative penalties under these medical
privacy laws may reach $250,000 per violation or for each reported event.

State consumer protection laws may also provide the basis for legal action for privacy and
security breaches and frequently, unlike HIPAA, authorize a private right of action. In particular, the
public nature of security incidents exposes health organizations to increased risk of individual or class
action lawsuits from patients or other affected persons, in addition to government enforcement and
negative media attention. Failure to comply with restrictions on patient privacy or to maintain robust
information security safeguards, including taking steps to ensure that contractors who have access to
sensitive patient information maintain the confidentiality of such information, could consequently damage
a hospital’s reputation and materially adversely affect business operations.

In any hospital, there can be security incidents related to patient information, which stem from a

<p>EMTALA.  The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”) is a federal 
civil statute that requires hospitals to treat or conduct a medical screening for emergency conditions and 
to stabilize a patient’s emergency medical condition before releasing, discharging or transferring the 
patient.  A hospital that violates EMTALA is subject to civil penalties of up to $103,139 per offense and 
exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Over the last few years, the federal government 
has increased its enforcement of EMTALA.  In addition, the hospital may be liable for any claim by an 
individual who has suffered harm as a result of a violation.

<p>Licensing, Surveys, Investigations and Accreditations.  Health facilities are subject to numerous 
legal, regulatory, professional and private licensing, certification and accreditation requirements.  These 
include, but are not limited to, requirements of state licensing agencies and The Joint Commission.  
Renewal and continuation of certain of these licenses, certifications and accreditations are based on 
inspections or other reviews generally conducted in the normal course of business of health facilities.  
Loss of, or limitations imposed on, hospital licenses or accreditations could reduce hospital utilization or 
revenues, or a hospital’s ability to operate all or a portion of its facilities or to bill various third party 
payors.  Certain states, including California, can levy penalties against hospitals that experience certain 
significant patient care events, including those that are classified as posing “immediate jeopardy” to 
patient health and safety.  In California, the administrative penalty for such incidents occurring on or after 
April 1, 2014 is up to a maximum of $75,000 for the first incident, up to $100,000 for the second, and up 
to $125,000 for the third and every subsequent violation within three (3) years.

</p>
<p>Enforcement Activity.  Enforcement activity against health care providers has increased, and 
enforcement authorities have adopted aggressive approaches.  In the current regulatory climate, it is

</p>
<p>Enforcement authorities are often in a position to compel settlements by providers charged with 
or being investigated for false claims violations by withholding or threatening to withhold Medicare, 
Medicaid and similar payments or to recover higher damages, assessments or penalties by instituting 
criminal action.  In addition, the cost of defending such an action, the time and management attention 
consumed, and the facts of a case may dictate settlement.  Therefore, regardless of the merits of a 
particular case, a hospital could experience materially adverse settlement costs, as well as materially 
adverse costs associated with implementation of any settlement agreement.  Prolonged and publicized 
investigations could be damaging to the reputation and business of a hospital, regardless of outcome. 
</p>
<p>Certain acts or transactions may result in violation or alleged violation of a number of the federal 
health care fraud laws described above, and therefore penalties or settlement amounts often are 
compounded.  Generally these risks are not covered by insurance.  Enforcement actions may involve 
multiple hospitals or other facilities in a health system, as the government often extends enforcement 
actions regarding health care fraud to other entities in the same organization.  Therefore, Medicare fraud

<p>Integrated Delivery Systems.  Hospitals and health care systems often own, control or have

facility or health system is the primary capital and funding source for such alliances and may have an 
ongoing financial commitment to provide growth capital and support operating deficits.  As separate 
operating units, integrated physician practices and medical foundations sometimes operate at a loss and 
require subsidies or other support from the related hospital or health system.  In addition, integrated 
delivery systems present business challenges and risks.  Inability to attract or retain participating 
physicians may negatively affect managed care, contracting and utilization.  The technological and 
administrative infrastructure necessary both to develop and operate integrated delivery systems and to

</p>
<p>Whether these programs will achieve their objectives and be expanded or mandated as conditions

continuing the trend away from the fee-for-service reimbursement model, which began in the 1980s with 
the introduction of the prospective payment system for inpatient care, and toward an episode-based 
payment model that rewards use of evidence-based protocols, quality and satisfaction in patient outcomes, 
efficiency in using resources, and the ability to measure and report clinical performance.  This shift is 
likely to favor integrated delivery systems, which may be better able than stand-alone providers to realize 
efficiencies, coordinate services across the continuum of patient care, track performance and monitor and 
control patient outcomes.  Changes to the reimbursement methods and payment requirements of 
Medicare, which is the dominant purchaser of medical services, are likely to prompt equivalent changes

to set standards, reduce costs and share savings, among other things.  The ability of hospitals or health 
systems to conduct integrated physician operations may be altered or eliminated in the future by legal or 
regulatory interpretation or changes, or by health care fraud enforcement.  In addition, participating 
physicians may seek their independence for a variety of reasons, thus putting the hospital or health 
system’s investment at risk, and potentially reducing its managed care leverage and/or overall utilization.  
In October 2011, CMS, the Federal Trade Commission and DOJ jointly issued guidance regarding 
waivers and safe harbors to enable providers to participate in the Medicare Shared Savings Program.  
There can be no assurance that such waivers or other regulations or guidance will sufficiently clarify the

the hospitals and health systems. 
</p>
<p>Health care providers, responding to health care reform and other industry pressures, are 
increasingly moving toward integrated delivery systems, managing the health of populations of

and new relationships between patients and providers.  Provider organizations may be unsuccessful in 
assembling successful integrated networks, may not achieve savings sufficient to offset the substantial 
costs of creating and maintaining the necessary infrastructures to support such developments, or otherwise 
could incur losses or damage reputations from assuming increased risk and could incur damage to 
reputations.  Some health care organizations that traditionally operated hospitals may, directly or in

<p>Physician Financial Relationships.  In addition to the physician integration relationships 
referred to above, hospitals and health systems frequently have various additional business and financial 
relationships with physicians and physician groups.  These are in addition to hospital physician contracts 
for individual services performed by physicians in hospitals.  They potentially include: joint ventures to 
provide a variety of outpatient services; recruiting arrangements with individual physicians and/or 
physician groups; loans to physicians; medical office leases; equipment leases from or to physicians; and 
various forms of physician practice support or assistance.  These and other financial relationships with 
physicians (including hospital physician contracts for individual services) may involve financial and legal 
compliance risks for the hospitals and health systems involved.  From a compliance standpoint, these 
types of financial relationships may raise federal and state “anti-kickback” and federal “Stark” issues (see 
“—Regulatory Environment,” above), tax exemption issues (see “—Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax 
Matters,” below), as well as other legal and regulatory risks, and these could have a material adverse 
impact on hospitals. 
</p>
<p>Accountable Care Organizations.  The ACA established a Medicare Shared Savings Program 
(the “MSSP”) that seeks to promote accountability and coordination of care through the creation of 
ACOs.  The program allows hospitals, physicians and others to form ACOs and work together to invest in 
infrastructure and redesign integrated delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of 
services.  ACOs that achieve quality performance standards will be eligible to share in a portion of the 
amounts saved by the Medicare program.  DHHS has significant discretion to determine key elements of 
the program, including what steps providers must take to be considered an ACO, how to decide if 
Medicare program savings have occurred, and what portion of such savings will be paid to ACOs. 
</p>
<p>To qualify as an ACO, organizations must agree to be accountable for the overall care of their 
Medicare beneficiaries, have adequate participation of primary care physicians, define processes to 
promote evidence-based medicine, report on quality and costs, and coordinate care.  The ACO and MSSP 
final rules were published in November 2011 and June 2015; however, the regulations are complex and it 
remains unclear whether the qualification requirements will be a formidable barrier for providers.  It is 
probable that hospital participants in ACOs will have to marshal a large upfront financial investment to 
form unique and untested ACO structures, which may or may not succeed in gaining qualification.  For 
those ACOs that do qualify, it is not clear if the savings will be adequate to recoup the initial investment.  
In addition, although the regulation provides for waivers of certain federal laws, there may remain 
regulatory risks for participating hospitals, as well as financial and operational risks.  The applicable 
regulating bodies have published guidance for ACOs to follow in order to comply with the law, but the 
published guidance is complex. 
</p>
<p>In particular, because the federal ACO regulation would not preempt state law, California 
providers participating as a federal ACO must be organized and operated in compliance with California’s 
existing statutes and regulations.  Numerous organizations have formed ACOs and been selected by CMS 
to participate in the MSSP.  CMS is also developing and implementing more advanced ACO payment 
models, such as the Next Generation ACO Model, which require ACOs to assume greater risk for 
attributed beneficiaries.  Providers participating in MSSP and other ACO payment models developed by 
CMS may not be able to recoup their investments and may suffer further losses if they are not able to 
meet quality targets and sufficiently control the cost of care for their attributed beneficiaries.  In addition, 
it is anticipated that private insurers may seek to establish similar incentives for providers, while requiring 
change in infrastructure and organization.  The potential impacts of these initiatives and the regulation for 
ACOs are unknown and continually evolving, but introduce greater risk and complexity to health care 
finance and operations.

impact on hospitals.

Accountable Care Organizations. The ACA established a Medicare Shared Savings Program
(the “MSSP”) that seeks to promote accountability and coordination of care through the creation of
ACOs. The program allows hospitals, physicians and others to form ACOs and work together to invest in
infrastructure and redesign integrated delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of
services. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards will be eligible to share in a portion of the
amounts saved by the Medicare program. DHHS has significant discretion to determine key elements of
the program, including what steps providers must take to be considered an ACO, how to decide if
Medicare program savings have occurred, and what portion of such savings will be paid to ACOs.

To qualify as an ACO, organizations must agree to be accountable for the overall care of their
Medicare beneficiaries, have adequate participation of primary care physicians, define processes to
promote evidence-based medicine, report on quality and costs, and coordinate care. The ACO and MSSP
final rules were published in November 2011 and June 2015; however, the regulations are complex and it
remains unclear whether the qualification requirements will be a formidable barrier for providers. It is
probable that hospital participants in ACOs will have to marshal a large upfront financial investment to
form unique and untested ACO structures, which may or may not succeed in gaining qualification. For
those ACOs that do qualify, it is not clear if the savings will be adequate to recoup the initial investment.
In addition, although the regulation provides for waivers of certain federal laws, there may remain
regulatory risks for participating hospitals, as well as financial and operational risks. The applicable
regulating bodies have published guidance for ACOs to follow in order to comply with the law, but the
published guidance is complex.

In particular, because the federal ACO regulation would not preempt state law, California
providers participating as a federal ACO must be organized and operated in compliance with California’s
existing statutes and regulations. Numerous organizations have formed ACOs and been selected by CMS
to participate in the MSSP. CMS is also developing and implementing more advanced ACO payment
models, such as the Next Generation ACO Model, which require ACOs to assume greater risk for
attributed beneficiaries. Providers participating in MSSP and other ACO payment models developed by
CMS may not be able to recoup their investments and may suffer further losses if they are not able to
meet quality targets and sufficiently control the cost of care for their attributed beneficiaries. In addition,
it is anticipated that private insurers may seek to establish similar incentives for providers, while requiring
change in infrastructure and organization. The potential impacts of these initiatives and the regulation for
ACOs are unknown and continually evolving, but introduce greater risk and complexity to health care
finance and operations.

Hospital Pricing. Inflation in hospital prices may evoke action by legislatures, payors or
consumers. It is possible that legislative action at the state or national level may be taken with regard to

44
</div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  45 
</p>
<p>the pricing of health care services.  California law requires every hospital to offer reduced rates to 
underinsured and uninsured patients that may have low to moderate income. 
</p>
<p>Hospital Medical Staff.  The primary relationship between a hospital and physicians who practice 
in it is through the hospital’s organized medical staff.  Medical staff bylaws, rules and policies establish 
the criteria and procedures by which a physician may have his or her privileges or membership curtailed, 
denied or revoked.  Physicians who are denied medical staff membership or certain clinical privileges or 
who have such membership or privileges curtailed or revoked often file legal actions against hospitals and 
medical staffs.  Such actions may include a wide variety of claims, some of which could result in 
substantial uninsured damages to a hospital.  In addition, failure of the hospital governing body to 
adequately oversee the conduct of its medical staff may result in hospital liability to third parties. 
</p>
<p>Physician Supply.  Sufficient community-based physician supply is important to hospitals and 
other health care facilities.  CMS annually reviews overall physician reimbursement formulas for 
Medicare and Medicaid.  Changes to physician compensation under these programs could lead to 
physicians ceasing to accept Medicare and/or Medicaid patients.  Regional differences in reimbursement 
by commercial and governmental payors, along with variations in the costs of living, may cause 
physicians to avoid locating their practices in communities with low reimbursement or high living costs.  
Hospitals and health systems may be required to invest additional resources in recruiting and retaining 
physicians, or may be compelled to affiliate with, and provide support to, physicians in order to continue 
serving the growing population base and maintain market share.  The physician-to-population ratio in 
certain parts of the State is below the national average, and the shortage of physicians could become a 
significant issue for hospitals and health care systems in the State.  Difficulties in recruiting or retaining 
physicians may reduce the volume or range of clinical services that a hospital is capable of providing and 
may, consequently, decrease patient service revenues. 
</p>
<p>Children’s Hospital Graduate Medical Education Program.  The Children’s Hospital Graduate 
Medical Education (“CHGME”) Program is a federal funding program that reimburses children’s 
hospitals for the cost of training residents.  Funds for the CHGME Program are appropriated annually by 
Congress.  For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016, the Corporation received approximately 
$7.7 million in CHGME funding, which partially offset the Corporation’s costs associated with training 
pediatric residents.  There can be no assurance that the Corporation will continue to receive CHGME 
funding or that such funding will be adequate to cover the Corporation’s costs for training residents. 
</p>
<p>Section 340B Drug Pricing Program.  Hospitals that participate (as “covered entities”) in the 
prescription drug discount program established under Section 340B of the federal Public Health Service 
Act (the “340B Program”) are able to purchase certain outpatient prescription drugs for their patients at a 
reduced cost.  On August 28, 2015 the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) 
published proposed 340B Drug Pricing Program Omnibus Guidance in the Federal Register, 80 Fed. Reg. 
52300 (“Proposed Guidance”).  On January 30, 2017, HRSA withdrew its Proposed Guidance.  In 
withdrawing that guidance, HRSA has indicated that the Proposed Guidance will not be adopted as 
originally proposed.  Although HRSA could re-introduce similar guidance in the future, new guidance 
may also be introduced that materially differs from the original proposal.  To the extent that HRSA adopts 
final guidance as proposed, such guidance could have a material negative financial impact on the 
Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Competition Among Health Care Providers.  Increased competition from a wide variety of 
sources, including specialty hospitals, other hospitals and health care systems, HMOs, inpatient and 
outpatient health care facilities, long-term care and skilled nursing services facilities, clinics, physicians 
and others, may adversely affect the utilization and/or revenues of hospitals.  Existing and potential 
competitors may not be subject to various restrictions applicable to hospitals, and competition, in the </p>

Competition Among Health Care Providers. \ncreased competition from a wide variety of
sources, including specialty hospitals, other hospitals and health care systems, HMOs, inpatient and
outpatient health care facilities, long-term care and skilled nursing services facilities, clinics, physicians
and others, may adversely affect the utilization and/or revenues of hospitals. Existing and potential

</p>
<p>future, may arise from new sources not currently anticipated or prevalent.  The strong market position of 
Kaiser Permanente, a closed managed care system, presents additional challenges. 
</p>
<p>Freestanding ambulatory surgery centers may attract away significant commercial outpatient 
services traditionally performed at hospitals.  Commercial outpatient services, currently among the most 
profitable services for hospitals, may be lost to competitors who can provide these services in an 
alternative, less costly setting.  Full-service hospitals rely upon the revenues generated from commercial 
outpatient services to fund other less profitable services, and the decline of such business may result in the 
significant reduction of profitable income.  Competing ambulatory surgery centers, more likely for-profit 
businesses, may not accept indigent patients or low paying programs and would leave these populations 
to receive services in the full-service hospital setting.  Consequently, hospitals are vulnerable to 
competition from ambulatory surgery centers. 
</p>
<p>Additionally, scientific and technological advances, new procedures, drugs and appliances, 
preventive medicine and outpatient health care delivery may reduce utilization and revenues of the 
hospitals in the future or otherwise lead to new avenues of competition.  In some cases, hospital 
investment in facilities and equipment for capital-intensive services may be lost as a result of rapid 
changes in diagnosis, treatment or clinical practice brought about by new technology or new 
pharmacology. 
</p>
<p>Action by Purchasers of Hospital Services and Consumers.  Major purchasers of hospital 
services could take action to restrain hospital charges or charge increases.  As a result of increased public 
scrutiny, it is also possible that the pricing strategies of hospitals may be perceived negatively by 
consumers, and hospitals may be forced to reduce fees for their services.  Decreased utilization could 
result, and hospitals’ revenues may be negatively impacted.  In addition, consumers and groups on behalf 
of consumers are increasing pressure for hospitals and other health care providers to be transparent and 
provide information about cost and quality of services that may affect future consumer choices about 
where to receive health care services. 
</p>
<p>Employer Status.  Hospitals are major employers with mixed technical and nontechnical 
workforces.  Labor costs, including salary, benefits and other liabilities associated with a workforce, have 
significant impacts on hospital operations and financial condition.  Developments affecting hospitals as 
major employers include: (i) imposing higher minimum or living wages; (ii) enhancing occupational 
health and safety standards; (iii) imposing joint employer status on employers using contract, staffing 
agency or other temporary labor; (iv) penalizing employers of undocumented immigrants; and 
(v) complying with the employer requirements of the ACA.  Legislation or regulation on any of the above 
or related topics could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Labor Relations and Collective Bargaining.  Hospitals are large employers with a wide diversity 
of employees.  Increasingly, employees of hospitals are becoming unionized, and many hospitals have 
collective bargaining agreements with one or more labor organizations.  Employees subject to collective 
bargaining agreements may include essential nursing and technical personnel, as well as food service, 
maintenance and other trade personnel.  Renegotiation of such agreements upon expiration may result in 
significant cost increases to hospitals.  Employee strikes or other adverse labor actions may have an 
adverse impact on operations, revenue and hospital reputation.  Certain employees of the Corporation are 
currently covered by collective bargaining agreements.  See APPENDIX A – “INFORMATION 
CONCERNING LUCILE SALTER PACKARD CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AT STANFORD—OTHER 
INFORMATION—Employees.”

Class Actions. Nonprofit hospitals and health systems have long been subject to a wide variety
of litigation risks, including liability for care outcomes, employer liability, property and premises liability,

46
</div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  47 
</p>
<p>and peer review litigation with physicians, among others.  In recent years, consumer class action litigation 
has emerged as a potentially significant source of litigation liability for nonprofit hospitals and health 
systems.  These class action suits have most recently focused on hospital billing and collections practices, 
and they may be used for a variety of currently unanticipated causes of action.  Since the subject matter of 
class action suits may involve uninsured risks, and since such actions often involve alleged large classes 
of plaintiffs, they may have material adverse consequences on nonprofit hospitals and health systems in 
the future. 
</p>
<p>Wage and Hour Class Actions and Litigation.  Federal law and many states, including notably 
California, impose standards related to worker classification, eligibility and payment for overtime, 
liability for providing rest periods and similar requirements.  Large employers with complex workforces, 
such as hospitals, are susceptible to actual and alleged violations of these standards.  In recent years there 
has been a proliferation of lawsuits over these “wage and hour” issues, often in the form of large class 
actions.  For large employers, such as hospitals and health systems, such class actions can involve multi-
million dollar claims, judgments and settlements.  A major class action decided or settled adversely to the 
Corporation could have a material adverse impact on the financial conditions and results of operations. 
</p>
<p>Health Care Worker Classification.  Health care providers, like all businesses, are required to 
withhold income taxes from amounts paid to employees.  If the employer fails to withhold the tax, the 
employer becomes liable for payment of the tax imposed on the employee.  On the other hand, businesses 
are not required to withhold federal taxes from amounts paid to a worker classified as an independent 
contractor.  The IRS has established criteria for determining whether a worker is an employee or an 
independent contractor for tax purposes.  If the IRS were to reclassify a significant number of hospital 
independent contractors (e.g., physician medical directors) as employees, back taxes and penalties could 
be material. 
</p>
<p>Staffing.  From time to time, the health care industry suffers from a scarcity of nursing personnel, 
respiratory therapists, pharmacists and other trained health care and information system technicians.  In 
addition, aging medical and nursing staffs and difficulties in recruiting individuals to these medical 
professions are predicted to result in shortages.  A significant factor underlying this trend includes a 
decrease in the number of persons entering such professions.  This is expected to intensify in the future, 
aggravating the general shortage and increasing the likelihood of hospital-specific shortages.  
Competition for physicians and other health care professionals, coupled with increased recruiting and 
retention costs, will increase hospital operating costs, possibly significantly, and growth may be 
constrained.  This trend could have a material adverse impact on the financial conditions and results of 
operations of hospitals and other health care facilities.  This scarcity may further be intensified if 
utilization of health care services increases as a consequence of the ACA’s expansion of the number of 
insured consumers.  As reimbursement amounts are reduced to health care facilities and organizations that 
employ or contract with physicians, nurses and other health care professionals, pressure to control and 
possibly reduce wage and benefit costs may further strain the supply of those professionals. 
</p>
<p>California imposes mandatory nurse staffing ratios for all hospital patient care areas, which have 
been consistent since January 1, 2008.  The impact on California hospitals will vary by facility, but the 
required staffing, in aggregate, is more costly than prior staffing patterns. 
</p>
<p>Professional Liability Claims and General Liability Insurance.  In recent years, the number of 
professional and general liability suits and the dollar amounts of damage recoveries have increased in 
health care nationwide, resulting in substantial increases in malpractice insurance premiums, higher 
deductibles and generally less coverage.  Professional liability and other actions alleging wrongful 
conduct and seeking punitive damages are often filed against health care providers.  Insurance does not 
provide coverage for judgments for punitive damages. </p>

</p>
<p>Litigation also arises from the corporate and business activities of hospitals, from a hospital’s 
status as an employer or as a result of medical staff or provider network peer review or the denial of 
medical staff or provider network privileges.  As with professional liability, many of these risks are 
covered by insurance, but some are not.  For example, some antitrust claims or business disputes are not 
covered by insurance or other sources and may, in whole or in part, be a liability of the Corporation if 
determined or settled adversely. 
</p>
<p>There is no assurance that hospitals will be able to maintain coverage amounts currently in place 
in the future, that the coverage will be sufficient to cover malpractice judgments rendered against a 
hospital or that such coverage will be available at a reasonable cost in the future. 
</p>
<p>Information Systems.  The ability to adequately price and bill health care services and to 
accurately report financial results depends on the integrity of the data stored within information systems, 
as well as the operability of such systems.  Information systems require an ongoing commitment of 
significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep 
pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory 
standards.  There can be no assurance that efforts to upgrade and expand information systems capabilities, 
protect and enhance these systems, and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in 
information processing technology will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the 
future.
</p>
<p>Electronic media are also increasingly being used in clinical operations, including the conversion 
from paper to electronic medical records, computerization of order entry functions and the 
implementation of clinical decision-support software.  The reliance on information technology for these 
purposes imposes new expectations on physicians and other workforce members to be adept in using and 
managing electronic systems.  It also introduces risks related to patient safety, and to the privacy, 
accessibility and preservation of health information.  See “—Regulatory Environment—HIPAA, 
HITECH, and Other Privacy and Security Requirements “ above.  Technology malfunctions or failure to 
understand and use information systems properly could result in the dissemination of or reliance on 
inaccurate information, as well as in disputes with patients, physicians and other health care professionals.  
Health information systems may also be subject to different or higher standards or greater regulation than 
other information technology or the paper-based systems previously used by health care providers, which 
may increase the cost, complexity and risks of operations.  All of these risks may have adverse 
consequences on hospitals and health care providers. 
</p>
<p>Future government regulation and adherence to technological advances could result in an 
increased need of the Corporation to implement new technology.  Such implementation could be costly 
and is subject to cost overruns and delays in application, which could negatively affect the financial 
condition of the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Cybersecurity Risks.  Health care providers are highly dependent upon integrated electronic 
medical record and other information technology systems to deliver high quality, coordinated and cost-
effective health care.  These systems necessarily hold large quantities of highly sensitive PHI or other 
sensitive information that is highly valued on the black market for such information.  As a result, the 
electronic systems and networks of health care providers are considered likely targets for cyberattacks and 
other potential breaches of their systems.  Information technology systems are also vulnerable to random 
attacks, computer viruses, and physical or electronic break-ins.  In addition to regulatory fines and 
penalties, the health care entities subject to the breaches may be liable for the costs of remediating the 
breaches, damages to individuals (or classes) whose information has been breached, reputational damage 
and business loss, and damage to the information technology infrastructure.  The Corporation has taken, 
and continues to take measures to protect its information technology system against such cyberattacks and </p>

will not experience a significant breach.  If such a breach occurs, the financial consequences of such a 
breach could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation. 
</p>
<p>Increasing Cost of Modern Technology.  Technological advances in recent years have forced 
hospitals to acquire sophisticated and costly equipment to remain competitive.  Moreover, the growth of 
e-commerce may also result in a shift in the way that health care is delivered, i.e., from remote locations.  
For example, physicians will be able to provide certain services over the internet and pharmaceuticals and 
other health services may be purchased online.  If, due to financial constraints, the Corporation were less 
able to acquire new technology required to remain competitive, the Corporation could lose market share, 
and the financial condition of the Corporation could be materially adversely affected.
</p>
<p>Payment Card Industry Security Standards.  Health care providers have seen significant changes 
in the method, amount of transactions and dollar amount of patient payments.  Health care providers 
recognize that financial data security is a paramount concern as is continuing to protect and secure patient 
information.  Chip cards used at Europay, MasterCard and Visa (“EMV”) terminals protect against 
counterfeit transactions by replacing static data with dynamic data.  Merchants are in the process of 
migrating to EMV chip card technology to improve the security of the card-present payments 
infrastructure.  As a result, EMV is being introduced to health care providers. 
</p>
<p>Beginning October 1, 2015, the liability for card-present fraud shifts to whichever party is the 
least EMV-compliant in a fraudulent transaction.  This means in practice that if a health care provider has 
not updated its system to accept chip cards and fraud occurs when a chip card is inserted into the terminal, 
the health care provider would be liable for the costs.  It is not mandatory to begin using EMV compliant 
terminals on or after October 1, 2015 and there are no fines or other penalties currently in place, however, 
a health care provider that does not use EMV-compliant terminals may face much higher costs in the 
event of a large data breach.  At this time, it is too early to predict the impact that this new technology 
will have on the Corporation.

<p>Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax Matters 
</p>
<p>Maintenance of the Tax-Exempt Status of the Corporation and any future Members of the 
Obligated Group.  The tax-exempt status of the Bonds depends upon maintenance by each Obligated 
Group Member, consisting currently only of the Corporation, that receives or benefits from the proceeds 
of the Bonds (the “Benefiting Member”) of its status as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of 
the Code.  The maintenance of such status is contingent on compliance with general rules promulgated in 
the Code and related regulations regarding the organization and operation of tax-exempt entities, 
including their operation for charitable and other permissible purposes and their avoidance of transactions 
that may cause their earnings or assets to inure to the benefit of private individuals.  As these general 
principles were developed primarily for public charities that do not conduct large-scale technical 
operations and business activities, they often do not adequately address the myriad of operations and 
transactions entered into by a modern health care organization.  Although traditional activities of health 
care providers, such as medical office building leases, have been the subject of interpretations by the IRS 
in the form of private letter rulings, many activities or categories of activities have not been fully 
addressed in any official opinion, interpretation or policy of the IRS. 
</p>
<p>The IRS has taken the position that hospitals which are in violation of the Anti-Kickback Law 
may also be subject to revocation of their tax-exempt status.  See “—Regulatory Environment—Anti-
Kickback Law” above.  As a result, tax-exempt hospitals, such as the Corporation, which have, and will 
continue to have, extensive relationships with physicians are subject to an increased degree of scrutiny 
and perhaps enforcement by the IRS. </p>

Increasing Cost of Modern Technology. Technological advances in recent years have forced
hospitals to acquire sophisticated and costly equipment to remain competitive. Moreover, the growth of
e-commerce may also result in a shift in the way that health care is delivered, i.e., from remote locations.
For example, physicians will be able to provide certain services over the internet and pharmaceuticals and
other health services may be purchased online. If, due to financial constraints, the Corporation were less
able to acquire new technology required to remain competitive, the Corporation could lose market share,
and the financial condition of the Corporation could be materially adversely affected.

Tax-Exempt Status and Other Tax Matters

<p>The ACA also contains new requirements for tax-exempt hospitals through Section 501(r) of the 
Code.  Under the ACA, each tax-exempt hospital facility is required to (i) conduct a community health 
needs assessment at least every three years and adopt an implementation strategy to meet the identified 
community needs, (ii) adopt, implement and widely publicize a written financial assistance policy and 
adopt a written policy to provide emergency medical treatment without discrimination, (iii) limit charges 
to individuals who qualify for financial assistance under such tax-exempt hospital’s financial assistance 
policy to no more than the amounts generally billed to individuals who have insurance covering such care 
and refrain from using “gross charges” when billing such individuals, and (iv) refrain from taking 
extraordinary collection actions without first making reasonable efforts to determine whether the 
individual is eligible for assistance under such tax-exempt hospital’s financial assistance policy. 
</p>
<p>On December 29, 2014, the Secretary of the Treasury issued final regulations under 
Section 501(r) of the Code that provide detailed and comprehensive guidance relating to requirements for 
community health needs assessments, financial assistance policies, emergency medical care policies, 
limitations on charges and billing and collection practices, and also provide guidance on consequences of 
failure to satisfy Section 501(r) requirements.  These final regulations are complex and may be 
administratively burdensome to implement.  Generally, the regulations apply to tax years beginning after 
December 29, 2015, and provide that a hospital organization may rely on a reasonable, good faith 
interpretation of the Section 501(r) requirements for tax years beginning on or before December 29, 2015, 
which may include compliance with certain prior proposed regulations under Section 501(r).  A failure to 
comply with the provisions of Section 501(r) and the final regulations issued thereunder could result in a 
loss of tax-exempt status or otherwise subject revenues of a hospital facility to federal income tax. 
</p>
<p>In addition, the Treasury Department is required to review information about each tax-exempt 
hospital’s community benefit activities at least once every three years, as well as to submit an annual 
report to Congress with information regarding the levels of charity care, bad debt expenses, unreimbursed 
costs of government programs, and costs incurred by tax-exempt hospitals for community benefit 
activities.  The periodic reviews and reports to Congress regarding the community benefits provided by 
501(c)(3) hospitals may increase the likelihood that Congress will require such hospitals to provide a 
minimum level of charity care in order to retain tax-exempt status and may increase IRS scrutiny of 
particular 501(c)(3) hospital organizations. 
</p>
<p>The Corporation participates in a variety of joint ventures and transactions with physicians either 
directly or indirectly.  Management believes that the joint ventures and transactions to which the 
Corporation is a party are consistent with the requirements of the Code as to tax-exempt status, but, as 
noted above, there is uncertainty as to the state of the law. 
</p>
<p>The IRS has periodically conducted audit and other enforcement activity regarding tax-exempt 
health care organizations.  Certain audits are conducted by teams of revenue agents, often take years to 
complete and require the expenditure of significant staff time by both the IRS and the audited 
organization.  These audits examine a wide range of possible issues, including tax-exempt bond 
financings, partnerships and joint ventures, retirement plans and employee benefits, employment taxes, 
political contributions and other matters.

<p>If the IRS were to find that the Corporation or any future Obligated Group Member has 
participated in activities in violation of certain regulations or rulings, the tax-exempt status of such entity

nonprofit health care corporations, it could do so in the future.  Loss of tax-exempt status by the

could be in jeopardy. Although the IRS has not frequently revoked the 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status of

<p>status also could result in substantial tax liabilities on income of the Corporation or any future Obligated 
Group Member.  For these reasons, loss of tax-exempt status of the Corporation could have a material 
adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Obligated Group. 
</p>
<p>In some cases, the IRS has imposed substantial monetary penalties on tax-exempt hospitals in lieu 
of revoking their tax-exempt status.  In those cases, the IRS and exempt hospitals entered into settlement 
agreements requiring the hospital to make substantial payments to the IRS. 
</p>
<p>In addition, the IRS may impose a penalty in the form of excise taxes on certain “excess benefit 
transactions” involving 501(c)(3) organizations and “disqualified persons.”  An excess benefit transaction 
is one in which a disqualified person or entity receives more than fair market value from the exempt 
organization or pays the exempt organization less than fair market value for property or services, or 
shares the net revenues of the tax-exempt entity.  A disqualified person is a person (or an entity) who is in 
a position to exercise substantial influence over the affairs of the exempt organization during the five 
years preceding an excess benefit transaction.  The statute imposes excise taxes on the disqualified person 
and any “organization manager” who knowingly participates in an excess benefit transaction.  These rules 
do not penalize the exempt organization itself, so there would be no direct impact on an Obligated Group 
Member or the tax status of the Bonds if an excess benefit transaction were subject to IRS enforcement, 
pursuant to these “intermediate sanctions” rules.  However, these intermediate sanctions do not replace 
other remedies available to the IRS, including revocation of tax-exempt status. 
</p>
<p>State and Local Tax Exemption.  Until recently, California has not been as active as the IRS in 
scrutinizing the income tax exemption of health care organizations.  With some overlap with the ACA’s 
mandates, California laws also require tax-exempt hospitals to conduct a community needs assessment, to 
adopt an implementation strategy, and to have a charity care policy.  It is possible that legislation may be 
proposed to strengthen the role of the California Franchise Tax Board and the Attorney General in 
supervising nonprofit health systems.  It is likely that the loss by the Corporation or any future Member of 
the Obligated Group of federal tax exemption would also trigger a challenge to its respective state tax 
exemption.  Depending on the circumstances, such event could be material and adverse. 
</p>
<p>State, county and local taxing authorities undertake audits and reviews of the operations of tax-
exempt health care providers with respect to their real property tax exemptions.  In some cases, 
particularly where authorities are dissatisfied with the amount of services provided to indigents, the real 
property tax-exempt status of the health care providers has been questioned.  For example, a court in New 
Jersey recently decided that a nonprofit hospital should pay property taxes on almost all of its property 
because it did not meet the legal test that it operated as a nonprofit, charitable organization during certain 
years.  At this time, it is uncertain whether this state-specific case will have a negative impact on the 
broader nonprofit hospital community.  Subjecting significant amounts of real property to taxation could 
adversely affect health care organizations.  The majority of the real property of the Corporation is 
currently treated as exempt from real property taxation. 
</p>
<p>It is not possible to predict the scope or effect of future state and local legislative or regulatory 
actions with respect to taxation of nonprofit corporations.  There can be no assurance that future changes 
in the laws and regulations of state or local governments will not materially adversely affect the financial 
condition of the Obligated Group by requiring payment of income, local property or other taxes. 
</p>
<p>Maintenance of Tax-Exempt Status of Interest on the Bonds.  The Code imposes a number of 
requirements that must be satisfied for interest on state and local obligations, such as the Bonds, to be 
excludable from gross income for federal income tax purposes.  These requirements include limitations 
on the use of bond proceeds and bond-financed property, limitations on the investment earnings of bond 
proceeds prior to expenditure, a requirement that certain investment earnings on bond proceeds be paid </p>

<p>IRS officials have indicated that resources will be invested in audits of tax-exempt bonds, 
including the use of bond proceeds, in the charitable organization sector, with specific reviews of private 
use.  In addition, under its compliance check program initiated in 2007, the IRS has from time to time 
sent post-issuance compliance questionnaires to several hundred nonprofit corporations that have 
borrowed on a tax-exempt basis regarding their post-issuance compliance with various requirements for 
maintaining the federal tax exemption of interest on their bonds.  The questionnaire includes questions 
relating to the borrower’s (i) record retention, which the IRS has particularly emphasized, (ii) qualified 
use of bond-financed property, (iii) compliance with arbitrage yield restriction and rebate requirements, 
(iv) debt management policies, and (v) voluntary compliance and education.  After analyzing responses, 
IRS representatives indicated that it had commenced a number of examinations of hospital tax-exempt 
bond issues with wide-ranging areas of inquiry.  In the final report summarizing findings and conclusions 
of the questionnaire responses, issued July 1, 2011, the IRS stressed the importance of formal post-
issuance compliance and record-keeping procedures.  IRS representatives indicate that more 
questionnaires may be sent to additional nonprofit organizations. 
</p>
<p>Effective with the 2008 tax year, tax-exempt organizations must also complete Schedules H, K 
and J to Form 990, which create additional reporting responsibilities.  On Schedule H, hospitals and 
health systems must report how they provide community benefit and specify certain billing and collection 
practices.  Schedule K requires detailed information related to certain outstanding bond issues of tax-
exempt borrowers, including information regarding operating, management and research contracts as well 
as private use compliance.  Tax-exempt organizations must also complete Schedule J, which requires 
reporting of compensation information for the organizations’ officers, directors, trustees, key employees, 
and other highly compensated employees. 
</p>
<p>There can be no assurance that responses by the Corporation or any future Member of the

<p>Limitations on Contractual and Other Arrangements Imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
As tax-exempt organizations, the Corporation and any future Obligated Group Member are limited with 
respect to their use of practice income guarantees, reduced rent on medical office space, low interest 
loans, joint venture programs and other means of recruiting and retaining physicians.  Uncertainty in this 
area has been reduced somewhat by the issuance by the IRS of guidelines on permissible physician 
recruitment practices.  The IRS scrutinizes a broad variety of contractual relationships commonly entered 
into by hospitals and has issued a detailed audit guide suggesting that field agents scrutinize numerous 
activities of the hospitals in an effort to determine whether any action should be taken with respect to 
limitations on or revocation of their tax-exempt status or assessment of additional tax.  Any suspension, 
limitation, or revocation of the Corporation or any future Member’s tax-exempt status or assessment of 
significant tax liability would have a materially adverse effect on the Obligated Group and might lead to 
loss of tax exemption of interest on the Bonds and other tax-exempt debt of the Obligated Group. 
</p>
<p>Other Risk Factors 
</p>
<p>Earthquakes.  Many hospitals in California are in close proximity to active earthquake faults.  A 
significant earthquake in Northern California could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation and 
could result in material damage and temporary or permanent cessation of operations at the Corporation’s 
facilities.  The Corporation currently does not carry earthquake insurance coverage.  See APPENDIX A – 
“INFORMATION CONCERNING LUCILE SALTER PACKARD CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AT 
STANFORD—OTHER INFORMATION—Insurance.” 
</p>
<p>California law requires each acute care hospital in the State to evaluate and upgrade its patient 
care facilities to meet stated seismic standards by 2008 or, in certain cases, by 2030; ultimate deadlines 
depend on each acute hospital building’s structural performance category.  OSHPD has been directed to

<div class="ocr">Limitations on Contractual and Other Arrangements Imposed by the Internal Revenue Code.
As tax-exempt organizations, the Corporation and any future Obligated Group Member are limited with
respect to their use of practice income guarantees, reduced rent on medical office space, low interest
loans, joint venture programs and other means of recruiting and retaining physicians. Uncertainty in this
area has been reduced somewhat by the issuance by the IRS of guidelines on permissible physician
recruitment practices. The IRS scrutinizes a broad variety of contractual relationships commonly entered
into by hospitals and has issued a detailed audit guide suggesting that field agents scrutinize numerous
activities of the hospitals in an effort to determine whether any action should be taken with respect to
limitations on or revocation of their tax-exempt status or assessment of additional tax. Any suspension,
limitation, or revocation of the Corporation or any future Member’s tax-exempt status or assessment of
significant tax liability would have a materially adverse effect on the Obligated Group and might lead to
loss of tax exemption of interest on the Bonds and other tax-exempt debt of the Obligated Group.

Other Risk Factors

Earthquakes. Many hospitals in California are in close proximity to active earthquake faults. A
significant earthquake in Northern California could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation and
could result in material damage and temporary or permanent cessation of operations at the Corporation’s
facilities. The Corporation currently does not carry earthquake insurance coverage. See APPENDIX A —
“INFORMATION CONCERNING LUCILE SALTER PACKARD CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AT
STANFORD—OTHER INFORMATION—Insurance.”

California law requires each acute care hospital in the State to evaluate and upgrade its patient
care facilities to meet stated seismic standards by 2008 or, in certain cases, by 2030; ultimate deadlines
depend on each acute hospital building’s structural performance category. OSHPD has been directed to
review previously established seismic performance categories for hospital buildings using new software
technology known as “HAZUS.” Reevaluation under HAZUS may result in buildings not being required
to meet any new seismic standards until 2030. California law has been amended to allow various types of
extensions of the 2008 deadline to 2013, 2015, 2016, 2018 or 2020, provided that the facility qualifies for
such extension and certain requirements are met in enumerated time periods, including demonstrating to

<p>Epidemics, Pandemics and Disasters.  An epidemic or pandemic, or a natural or man-made 
disaster could occur and result in an abnormally high demand for health care services, damage the 
facilities of the Corporation, interrupt utility service to the facilities, or otherwise impair the Corporation’s 
operations and the generation of revenues from the Corporation’s facilities.  For example, if an outbreak 
of an infectious disease such as the Zika virus or Ebola virus were to occur nationally or in the 
Corporation’s service area, its business and financial results could be adversely affected.  The treatment 
of a highly contagious disease at the Corporation’s hospital facilities may result in a temporary shutdown 
or diversion of patients.  In addition, unaffected individuals may decide to defer elective procedures or 
otherwise avoid medical treatment, resulting in reduced patient volumes and operating revenues.  The

<p>Reliance on Related Entities 
</p>
<p>The Corporation relies upon Stanford Health Care and Stanford University, including the 
Stanford University School of Medicine, for necessary services and facilities.  Disruption of such 
services, loss of access to such facilities, increases in charges for the use of such facilities or services and 
adverse developments affecting Stanford University or Stanford Health Care may adversely affect the 
operations and revenues of the Corporation, perhaps materially.  Such reliance exists for many beneficial 
reasons, including perceived efficiencies of scale, the avoidance of duplication, common purposes and the 
inherent interdependence of the teaching, research and clinical components of an academic medical 
center.  Nonetheless, these benefits may be offset by future developments affecting the availability or cost 
of such necessary services and facilities.  Such services and facilities include the patient care and 
administrative services of physicians and surgeons on the faculty of the Stanford University School of 
Medicine; the workforce staffing the Corporation’s facilities; shared administrative departments such as 
human resources, information systems, managed care contracting and materials management; access to 
operating rooms; the use of space within facilities of Stanford Health Care to house the obstetrical units 
operated by the Corporation; central laboratory services and various other diagnostic services provided 
from facilities operated by Stanford Health Care.  The Corporation relies on Stanford University for 
services and facilities essential to telecommunications, transportation, certain utilities, and various 
administrative services such as risk management and internal audit. 
</p>
<p>Although certain components of the Project will reduce or eliminate the use of similar facilities of 
Stanford Health Care, reliance on services and facilities of Stanford Health Care and Stanford University 
will continue for many essential activities of the Corporation.  Charges for these and other services and 
facilities are determined on the basis of their respective management’s best estimates of costs, which may 
or may not be the equivalent of fair market value.  The terms on which such services and facilities are

ABSENCE OF MATERIAL LITIGATION
Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital

There is no controversy or litigation of any nature now pending against Lucile Packard Children’s
Hospital or, to the knowledge of its officers, threatened, restraining or enjoining the issuance of the Bonds
or in any way contesting or affecting (i) the validity of the Bonds, or (ii) any proceedings of Lucile
Packard Children’s Hospital taken concerning the issuance or sale thereof or the collection of Revenues
pledged under the Indenture.

As with most health care providers, Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital is subject to certain legal

<p>or amount or types of damages requested (e.g., punitive damages), because of a reservation of rights by an

addition to the matters described above, there are certain legal actions currently pending against Lucile 
Packard Children’s Hospital known to management of Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital and for which 
insurance coverage is uncertain for the above reasons.  Management of Lucile Packard Children’s 
Hospital does not anticipate that any such suits will ultimately result in punitive damage awards or 
judgments in excess of applicable insurance limits, or if such awards or judgments were to be entered, 
that they would have a material adverse impact on the financial condition of Lucile Packard Children’s 
Hospital.

<p>TAX MATTERS 
</p>
<p>In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the Authority (“Bond 
Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and 
assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain 
covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under 
Section 103 of the Code and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes.  Bond Counsel is 
of the further opinion that interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the 
federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, although Bond Counsel observes that such 
interest is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable 
income.  A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in Appendix D

<p>To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at 
maturity of such Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the

extent properly allocable to each Beneficial Owner thereof, is treated as interest on such Bonds which is 
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and State of California personal income 
taxes.  For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of the Bonds is the first price at which a 
substantial amount of such maturity of such Bonds is sold to the public (excluding bond houses, brokers, 
or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or 
wholesalers).  The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the Bonds accrues daily over the 
term to maturity of such Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually (with 
straight-line interpolations between compounding dates).  The accruing original issue discount is added to 
the adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon disposition (including sale, 
redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Bonds.  Beneficial Owners of the Bonds should consult their 
own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Bonds with original issue discount, </p>

The Authority

To the knowledge of the officers of the Authority, there is no litigation of any nature now pending
(with service of process having been accomplished) or threatened against the Authority, seeking to
restrain or enjoin the issuance, sale, execution or delivery of the Bonds, or in any way contesting or
affecting the validity of the Bonds, any proceedings of the Authority taken concerning the issuance or sale
thereof, the pledge or application of any moneys or security provided for the payment of the Bonds, or the
existence or powers of the Authority relating to the issuance of the Bonds.

TAX MATTERS

In the opinion of Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the Authority (“Bond
Counsel”), based upon an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and court decisions, and
assuming, among other matters, the accuracy of certain representations and compliance with certain
covenants, interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes under
Section 103 of the Code and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes. Bond Counsel is
of the further opinion that interest on the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the
federal individual or corporate alternative minimum taxes, although Bond Counsel observes that such
interest is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating corporate alternative minimum taxable
income. A complete copy of the proposed form of opinion of Bond Counsel is set forth in Appendix D
hereto.

To the extent the issue price of any maturity of the Bonds is less than the amount to be paid at
maturity of such Bonds (excluding amounts stated to be interest and payable at least annually over the
term of such Bonds), the difference constitutes “original issue discount,” the accrual of which, to the
extent properly allocable to each Beneficial Owner thereof, is treated as interest on such Bonds which is
excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and State of California personal income
taxes. For this purpose, the issue price of a particular maturity of the Bonds is the first price at which a
substantial amount of such maturity of such Bonds is sold to the public (excluding bond houses, brokers,
or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers). The original issue discount with respect to any maturity of the Bonds accrues daily over the
term to maturity of such Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded semiannually (with
straight-line interpolations between compounding dates). The accruing original issue discount is added to
the adjusted basis of such Bonds to determine taxable gain or loss upon disposition (including sale,
redemption, or payment on maturity) of such Bonds. Beneficial Owners of the Bonds should consult their
own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of ownership of Bonds with original issue discount,

56
</div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  57 
</p>
<p>including the treatment of Beneficial Owners who do not purchase such Bonds in the original offering to 
the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such Bonds is sold to the public. 
</p>
<p>Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their 
principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds”) will 
be treated as having amortizable bond premium.  No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond 
premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is excluded from gross 
income for federal income tax purposes.  However, the amount of tax-exempt interest received, and a 
Beneficial Owner’s basis in a Premium Bond, will be reduced by the amount of amortizable bond 
premium properly allocable to such Beneficial Owner.  Beneficial Owners of Premium Bonds should 
consult their own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their 
particular circumstances. 
</p>
<p>The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from 
gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds.  The Authority 
and the Corporation have made certain representations and have covenanted to comply with certain 
restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the Bonds will not be 
included in federal gross income.  Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these 
covenants may result in interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax 
purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the Bonds.  The opinion of Bond Counsel 
assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants.  The opinion of Bond 
Counsel also assumes that actions of the Corporation, the Authority and other persons taken subsequent to 
the date of issuance of the Bonds will not cause any of the Bonds to exceed the $150,000,000 limitation 
on qualified 501(c)(3) bonds that do not finance hospital facilities, as set forth in Section 145(b) of the 
Code.  Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions 
taken (or not taken) or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond 
Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax 
status of interest on, the Bonds.  Accordingly, the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may 
not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters. 
</p>
<p>In addition, Bond Counsel has relied, among other things, on the opinion of Ropes &amp; Gray LLP, 
counsel to the Corporation, regarding the current qualification of the Corporation as an organization 
described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.  Such opinion is subject to a number of qualifications and 
limitations.  Bond Counsel has also relied upon representations of the Corporation concerning the 
Corporation’s “unrelated trade or business” activities as defined in Section 513(a) of the Code.  Neither 
Bond Counsel nor counsel to the Corporation has given any opinion or assurance concerning 
Section 513(a) of the Code and neither Bond Counsel nor counsel to the Corporation can give or has 
given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of the Corporation, or about the effect of future 
changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the resulting changes in 
enforcement thereof by the IRS.  Failure of the Corporation to be organized and operated in accordance 
with the IRS’s requirements for the maintenance of its status as an organization described in 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Code, or to operate the facilities financed by the Bonds in a manner that is 
substantially related to the Corporation’s charitable purpose under Section 513(a) of the Code, may result 
in interest payable with respect to the Bonds being included in federal gross income, possibly from the 
date of the original issuance of the Bonds. 
</p>
<p>Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross 
income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the 
ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on, the Bonds may 
otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, state or local tax liability.  The nature and extent of these 
other tax consequences depends upon the particular tax status of the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial </p>
<p/>
<div class="ocr">including the treatment of Beneficial Owners who do not purchase such Bonds in the original offering to
the public at the first price at which a substantial amount of such Bonds is sold to the public.

Bonds purchased, whether at original issuance or otherwise, for an amount higher than their
principal amount payable at maturity (or, in some cases, at their earlier call date) (“Premium Bonds’) will
be treated as having amortizable bond premium. No deduction is allowable for the amortizable bond
premium in the case of bonds, like the Premium Bonds, the interest on which is excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes. However, the amount of tax-exempt interest received, and a
Beneficial Owner’s basis in a Premium Bond, will be reduced by the amount of amortizable bond
premium properly allocable to such Beneficial Owner. Beneficial Owners of Premium Bonds should
consult their own tax advisors with respect to the proper treatment of amortizable bond premium in their
particular circumstances.

The Code imposes various restrictions, conditions and requirements relating to the exclusion from
gross income for federal income tax purposes of interest on obligations such as the Bonds. The Authority
and the Corporation have made certain representations and have covenanted to comply with certain
restrictions, conditions and requirements designed to ensure that interest on the Bonds will not be
included in federal gross income. Inaccuracy of these representations or failure to comply with these
covenants may result in interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax
purposes, possibly from the date of original issuance of the Bonds. The opinion of Bond Counsel
assumes the accuracy of these representations and compliance with these covenants. The opinion of Bond
Counsel also assumes that actions of the Corporation, the Authority and other persons taken subsequent to
the date of issuance of the Bonds will not cause any of the Bonds to exceed the $150,000,000 limitation
on qualified 501(c)(3) bonds that do not finance hospital facilities, as set forth in Section 145(b) of the
Code. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to determine (or to inform any person) whether any actions
taken (or not taken) or events occurring (or not occurring), or any other matters coming to Bond
Counsel’s attention after the date of issuance of the Bonds may adversely affect the value of, or the tax
status of interest on, the Bonds. Accordingly, the opinion of Bond Counsel is not intended to, and may
not, be relied upon in connection with any such actions, events or matters.

In addition, Bond Counsel has relied, among other things, on the opinion of Ropes &amp; Gray LLP,
counsel to the Corporation, regarding the current qualification of the Corporation as an organization
described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code. Such opinion is subject to a number of qualifications and
limitations. Bond Counsel has also relied upon representations of the Corporation concerning the
Corporation’s “unrelated trade or business” activities as defined in Section 513(a) of the Code. Neither
Bond Counsel nor counsel to the Corporation has given any opinion or assurance concerning
Section 513(a) of the Code and neither Bond Counsel nor counsel to the Corporation can give or has
given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of the Corporation, or about the effect of future
changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, the interpretation thereof or the resulting changes in
enforcement thereof by the IRS. Failure of the Corporation to be organized and operated in accordance
with the IRS’s requirements for the maintenance of its status as an organization described in
Section 501(c)(3) of the Code, or to operate the facilities financed by the Bonds in a manner that is
substantially related to the Corporation’s charitable purpose under Section 513(a) of the Code, may result
in interest payable with respect to the Bonds being included in federal gross income, possibly from the
date of the original issuance of the Bonds.

Although Bond Counsel is of the opinion that interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross
income for federal income tax purposes and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes, the
ownership or disposition of, or the accrual or receipt of amounts treated as interest on, the Bonds may
otherwise affect a Beneficial Owner’s federal, state or local tax liability. The nature and extent of these
other tax consequences depends upon the particular tax status of the Beneficial Owner or the Beneficial

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>  58 
</p>
<p>Owner’s other items of income or deduction.  Bond Counsel expresses no opinion regarding any such 
other tax consequences. 
</p>
<p>Current and future legislative proposals, if enacted into law, clarification of the Code or court 
decisions may cause interest on the Bonds to be subject, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to 
federal income taxation or to be subject to or exempted from state income taxation, or otherwise prevent 
Beneficial Owners from realizing the full current benefit of the tax status of such interest.  The 
introduction or enactment of any such legislative proposals or clarification of the Code or court decisions 
may also affect, perhaps significantly, the market price for, or marketability of, the Bonds.  Prospective 
purchasers of the Bonds should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential impact of any 
pending or proposed federal or state tax legislation, regulations or litigation, as to which Bond Counsel is 
expected to express no opinion. 
</p>
<p>The opinion of Bond Counsel is based on current legal authority, covers certain matters not 
directly addressed by such authorities, and represents Bond Counsel’s judgment as to the proper treatment 
of the Bonds for federal income tax purposes.  It is not binding on the IRS or the courts.  Furthermore, 
Bond Counsel cannot give and has not given any opinion or assurance about the future activities of the 
Authority or the Corporation, or about the effect of future changes in the Code, the applicable regulations, 
the interpretation thereof or the enforcement thereof by the IRS.  The Authority and the Corporation have 
covenanted, however, to comply with the requirements of the Code. 
</p>
<p>Bond Counsel’s engagement with respect to the Bonds ends with the issuance of the Bonds, and, 
unless separately engaged, Bond Counsel is not obligated to defend the Authority, the Corporation or the 
Beneficial Owners regarding the tax-exempt status of the Bonds in the event of an audit examination by 
the IRS.  Under current procedures, parties other than the Authority, the Corporation and their appointed 
counsel, including the Beneficial Owners, would have little, if any, right to participate in, the audit 
examination process.  Moreover, because achieving judicial review in connection with an audit 
examination of tax-exempt bonds is difficult, obtaining an independent review of IRS positions with 
which the Authority or the Corporation legitimately disagree, may not be practicable.  Any action of the 
IRS, including but not limited to selection of the Bonds for audit, or the course or result of such audit, or 
an audit of bonds presenting similar tax issues may affect the market price for, or the marketability of, the 
Bonds, and may cause the Authority, the Corporation or the Beneficial Owners to incur significant 
expense.
</p>
<p>APPROVAL OF LEGALITY 
</p>
<p>The validity of the Bonds and certain other legal matters are subject to the approving opinion of 
Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe LLP, Bond Counsel to the Authority.  A complete copy of the proposed 
form of Bond Counsel’s opinion is set forth as APPENDIX D hereto.  Bond Counsel undertakes no

<div class="ocr">INTRODUCTION
General

Lucile Salter Packard Children’s Hospital at Stanford (“Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital” or
“LPCH”), a California nonprofit public benefit corporation, currently owns and operates a 266-licensed
bed acute care pediatric and obstetric hospital (the “Existing Facility”) on the campus of Stanford
University (the “University”) in Palo Alto, California and 36 licensed beds and related services at other
facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area (the “Bay Area” or “San Francisco Bay Area”). Upon the
opening of its expanded hospital facilities (the “Expansion” and collectively with the Existing Facility,
the “Hospital”), LPCH anticipates that there will be a total of approximately 397 licensed beds at the
Hospital and its satellite facilities. LPCH is exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”’), as an organization described in
Section 501(c)(3) of the Code. The Existing Facility serves as a regional, national and international
referral center for tertiary and quaternary pediatric care and LPCH is the largest single provider of
pediatric hospital services in San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties and of obstetric hospital services in
San Mateo County. LPCH also provides a wide variety of outpatient services through its outpatient
clinics and related facilities, including a nonprofit medical foundation. LPCH is nationally recognized
in several clinical services, including transplantation, cardiothoracic surgery, oncology and
neurosurgery. In addition, LPCH and Stanford Health Care (“SHC”) are the primary clinical affiliates
of the Stanford University School of Medicine (the “Stanford School of Medicine’) for internship and
residency programs, clinical research and other programs that support the Stanford School of
Medicine’s academic mission. Within the Stanford School of Medicine, the Pediatric and Obstetrics
Faculty Practice Organization (“FPO”) exists to advance the missions of the Stanford School of
Medicine and LPCH where they intersect in the delivery of professional medical services. See
“FACILITIES AND PATIENT SERVICES” and “EDUCATION, TRAINING AND RESEARCH”
herein.

In 2011, LPCH, together with the Stanford School of Medicine, formed Packard Children’s
Health Alliance (““PCHA”), a nonprofit medical foundation corporation exempt from federal income
taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the
Code. PCHA is affiliated with Packard Medical Group, Inc. (the “Packard Medical Group”), a
physician-owned for-profit California professional corporation. PCHA and the Packard Medical Group
were established to provide a means for community pediatric specialists and subspecialists and
obstetricians to become part of the LPCH network of services. For more information about these
arrangements, see “FACILITIES AND PATIENT SERVICES—Academic and Clinical Excellence—
Packard Children’s Health Alliance and Packard Medical Group” herein.

LPCH, together with PCHA, the Packard Medical Group and the FPO, comprise and are known
in the marketplace as “Stanford Children’s Health.”

Effective September 1, 2016, LPCH became the sole member of Lucile Packard Foundation for
Children’s Health (““LPFCH”), a public charity, founded in 1996, whose mission is to elevate the
priority of children’s health and increase the quality and accessibility of children’s healthcare through
leadership and direct investment. LPFCH pursues its mission through two distinct and complementary
programs: (1) fundraising (development) for LPCH and the pediatric programs at the Stanford School
of Medicine and (2) grant-making and public information and educational programs to promote the
health and well-being of children through statewide and local partnerships and to raise awareness about
children’s health issues. LPFCH is exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of the
Code, as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code.

forepart of this Official Statement.

History

LPCH traces its origins to 1917 when the campus auxiliary of the then San Francisco-based
Stanford Clinics opened a summer convalescent program in Palo Alto for children with polio and
tuberculosis. Throughout the following one hundred years, LPCH (and its predecessors), in
collaboration with SHC (and its predecessors), the University and the Stanford School of Medicine,
developed facilities and programs that provide a full range of pediatric health care services. See
“Related Entities” below.

A major development in the evolution of LPCH was the construction of the Existing Facility,
with the help of a $40 million donation from David and Lucile Packard in 1986. Constructed as an
adjunct to SHC’s main hospital facilities, the Existing Facility opened in 1991 and continues to be the
main facility for LPCH. The primary purpose of the issuance of the Bonds is to provide funds to
continue the expansion and modernization of the Hospital and related health care facilities, including
reimbursement of certain of such costs, in order to support the high-acuity, complex pediatric care that
LPCH delivers. In addition, the proceeds of the Bonds may finance costs of routine capital
expenditures and the acquisition of the long-term ground lease interest in land and improvements
located on the University’s campus adjacent to the Existing Facility. See “PLAN OF FINANCING” in
the forepart of this Official Statement and “THE PROJECT” herein.

In 2003, to facilitate its capital formation and capital management activities, LPCH created an
Obligated Group, of which it is the sole member. See “SECURITY AND SOURCE OF PAYMENT
FOR THE BONDS—The Master Indenture” in the forepart of this Official Statement.

Related Entities

Continuing several decades of collaboration in medical services, research, education and
training, LPCH, SHC, the Stanford School of Medicine and other University departments maintain
close relationships at many levels of organization and operation. As a result of these relationships,
LPCH has several ongoing service arrangements and enters into various transactions with SHC, the
Stanford School of Medicine and other entities related to the University. For more information on these
arrangements and transactions with the University, the School of Medicine and SHC, see
“OPERATING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Related Party Transactions” herein.

LPCH is the only member of the Obligated Group created pursuant to the Master
Indenture. None of the University, SHC, PCHA, the Packard Medical Group or LPFCH is
obligated to make principal or interest payments on the Bonds. The University, SHC, LPFCH
and LPCH are not co-guarantors of the debt of each other, and the University, SHC and LPCH
receive separate credit ratings from rating agencies.

GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT
Board of Directors
LPCH currently is governed by a 32-member Board of Directors (the “Board”). The present
Board is comprised of 22 elected directors and 10 ex-officio directors, all of whom are also voting

directors. The bylaws of LPCH provide that the Committee on Trusteeship of the University’s Board of
Trustees or its designees nominate elected directors. Elected directors are elected by the University’s

<div class="ocr">Board of Trustees. Each elected director, except for a community pediatrician and/or obstetrician (a
“community physician”) as described below, serves for a three-year term commencing on the
appointment effective date and terminating at the end of the third year after the term commences unless
such director sooner dies, resigns or is removed, or until his or her successor is duly elected and
qualified. Elected directors are divided into three classes, equally sized to the extent possible so that the
terms of the elected directors in only one class expire in each year. With the exception of the
community physician seat on the Board, elected directors may serve up to three consecutive terms, and
are eligible for reelection to the Board after the lapse of one year. A community physician serving as an
elected director serves for a one-year term commencing on the appointment effective date and
terminating at the end of the first year after the term commences, unless such director sooner dies,
resigns or is removed, or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. The community
physician Board member may serve up to six consecutive one-year terms. The following table sets
forth the current membership of the Board.

FACILITIES AND PATIENT SERVICES
Overview

As a regional, national and international referral center for tertiary and quaternary pediatric
care, the Hospital provides critical care and general pediatric medical and surgical subspecialty care to
pediatric patients and obstetric services to expectant mothers.

Facilities and Infrastructure

Existing Facility. LPCH currently maintains a total of 302 licensed acute-care beds, 266
located at the Existing Facility and 36 located at three satellite facilities described below. The main
facilities of LPCH are located on the University’s campus in Palo Alto on land owned by the University

(Tt is anticipated that the number of licensed beds located at the Hospital will increase from 266 beds to 361 beds upon
commencement of services in the Expansion, up to 149 licensed beds of which are expected to be located in the
Expansion, with the remainder expected to be located in the Existing Facility.

®) Includes 6-bed joint venture NICU at Sequoia Hospital (Redwood City), and 30-bed pediatric medical/surgical unit at El
Camino Hospital (Mountain View).

LPCH also manages, through separate joint ventures, a 13-bed neonatal intensive care unit
(“NICU”) located at Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz; an 11-bed NICU and perinatal diagnostic
center located at Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital; a 27-bed pediatric inpatient unit and an 8-bed
pediatric intensive care unit at Sutter West Bay Hospitals-California Pacific Medical Center in San
Francisco; a 35-bed NICU, a 16-bed pediatric inpatient unit and an 8-bed pediatric intensive care unit at
John Muir Health in Walnut Creek; and a 6-bed NICU at Sequoia Hospital in Redwood City. With the
exception of the joint venture involving Sequoia Hospital, all of these joint venture beds remain on the
licenses of the host hospitals and are not included in LPCH’s licensed bed complement presented
above. For more information about these arrangements, see “FACILITIES AND PATIENT
SERVICES—Academic and Clinical Excellence” herein.

LPCH owns the Existing Facility, which is located in an approximately 275,000 square foot,
four-story structure located on the University’s campus in Palo Alto on land leased from the University.
The Existing Facility houses pediatric inpatient, outpatient, ancillary and support services and certain
administrative functions. A two-story parking structure owned by LPCH on land leased from the
University is adjacent to the Existing Facility. For a description of the Expansion, see “THE
PROJECT” herein.

Other physical facilities owned, leased or used by LPCH are described below and none of such
arrangements are anticipated to change upon the opening of the Expansion:

e LPCH leases and occupies approximately 31,000 square feet of space within SHC’s hospital
facility, which is connected to the Existing Facility through a common hallway. This space
houses inpatient obstetric services, the normal newborn nursery, the special care and
intermediate care nurseries and the Perinatal Diagnostic Center.

e LPCH leases from the University and unrelated parties approximately 118,000 square feet of
space in buildings located across from and next to the Existing Facility. LPCH uses this space
for outpatient pediatric specialty services.

<div class="ocr">e LPCH leases from unrelated parties approximately 274,000 square feet of space in buildings in
Palo Alto and Menlo Park for LPCH and PCHA outpatient and administrative functions.

e LPCH owns buildings with approximately 63,000 square feet of space in Campbell, California,
approximately 20 miles from the Hospital. LPCH uses this space for outpatient and
administrative functions as existing tenants vacate the premises when leases expire.

e LPCH owns a building with approximately 80,000 square feet of space in Sunnyvale,
California, approximately 11 miles from the Hospital. In May 2016, LPCH opened 65,000
square feet of this space for outpatient pediatric specialty services and a location for a Stanford
Children’s Health fertility practice.

e LPCH leases from unrelated parties approximately 13,000 square feet of space in a building in
Emeryville, California that houses FPO and PCHA professional practices and administrative
functions. LPCH also leases from unrelated parties approximately 6,000 square feet of space in
another building in Emeryville that houses FPO and PCHA professional practices and
administrative functions. These buildings are approximately 44 miles from the Hospital.

e LPCH also utilizes space within SHC’s hospital facility for certain administrative functions
through a shared services arrangement and relies upon certain space within SHC’s hospital
facility for certain purchased services, including cardiac catheterization and clinical laboratory
services.

Seismic Compliance. The Hospital Seismic Safety Act of the State of California (the “State of
California” or the “State”) requires licensed acute care functions to be conducted only in facilities that
meet specified seismic safety standards. All seismic safety standards must be met no later than 2030,
and there also are intermediate milestones that must be met by earlier deadlines.

Separate and distinct seismic safety standards apply to structural frame performance and for
non-structural element performance. The Existing Facility of LPCH is currently designated as level
SPC-3 and are compliant with the structural frame requirements, allowing use of the Existing Facility
past 2030 without modification or limitation.

LPCH is retrofitting discrete areas of the Existing Facility for compliance with the non-
structural performance standards (“NPC”), as the regulations currently require. LPCH has received
State approval to extend the deadline for NPC compliance to 2020. The retrofitting work consists of
bracing and anchoring non-structural elements such as pipes, conduits and equipment in discrete areas
of the Existing Facility. Building permits for the retrofitting have been received from the California
Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (““OSHPD”). The work is being phased to
minimize disruption to on-going patient care operations. The work has been in progress since the
spring of 2016 and all of the work is expected to be completed prior to the 2020 deadline for NPC
compliance.

LPCH currently relies and, upon the opening of the Expansion, anticipates continuing to rely
upon services located in the adjoining SHC hospital facility, such as clinical laboratory, transfusion,
pregnancy and newborn and materials management. Through SHC’s construction of a new hospital
facility and planned retrofits of the existing SHC hospital facility, the areas housing the SHC services
that support LPCH are expected to be made compliant with seismic safety standards by their approved
extension deadlines.

<div class="ocr">Information Technology Systems. LPCH completed its multi-year strategic implementation of
integrated enterprise information systems in mid-2014, which included the implementation of a full
Electronic Medical Record (“EMR”) system. The enterprise-wide EMR system enables inpatient,
outpatient and ambulatory service areas to work more efficiently and to coordinate patient care among
LPCH and other Bay Area pediatric providers.

In late 2015, HIMSS Analytics awarded LPCH its distinguished Level 7 designation for both
inpatient and ambulatory services that recognized LPCH’s enterprise use of the EMR system to support
the full continuum of care. In 2016, LPCH was recognized as one of the nation’s Best Hospital IT
Departments by Healthcare IT News based on survey responses received from LPCH’s information
technology staff ranking their satisfaction in areas such as workplace culture, organizational leadership
and professional development opportunities. LPCH has also been named one of “Health Care’s Most
Wired” by the American Hospital Association in 2015, 2016 and 2017.

LPCH has enhanced its Enterprise Resource Planning system (payroll, human resources,
general ledger and supply chain services) and developed an advanced analytics and business
intelligence program that enables improved data-driven decision making for clinical and operational
processes. In addition, LPCH continues to innovate by creating and implementing EMR-integrated
web-based clinical decision support tools that utilize data captured in the EMR system to support
clinicians to make the best decisions for their patients. An example is Premie BiliRecs which uses
information recorded in the EMR system about a premature infant’s gestational age and laboratory test
results and provides recommendations for management of high bilirubin levels. The outcomes from
these recommendations are then analyzed to update the quality of the recommendations.

The LPCH information technology team remains focused on advancing current and new
technologies to support cost-effective, higher quality care, clinical analytics, virtual care and the patient
experience. In connection with the opening of the Expansion, new systems such as audio-visual and
video conferencing, wayfinding systems, digital signage and the integration of smart TVs, network
gaming solutions, real time location systems, clinical communications systems and patient-oriented
tablets will be implemented in the Expansion. The upgrades of LPCH’s network infrastructures are
intended to help meet capacity and reliability network standards in the Hospital.

Vision 2025

In 2014, LPCH launched a review of its strategic plan, a process that became known as “Vision
2025.” The process was initiated by LPCH’s evaluation of its strategies and goals with a focus on the
Project and beyond. Over 300 individuals, including board members, managers, physicians and staff,
participated in the development of refreshed plans for each of LPCH’s significant clinical programs and
key clinical and support services, and updates to LPCH’s vision and mission statements. The Vision
2025 framework affirms LPCH’s overall strategic goal to be “The Preeminent Pediatric and Obstetric
Health System,” with three specific underlying strategic goals, (1) advancing academic and clinical
excellence, (11) expanding LPCH’s reach, and (iii) creating a value-based system, each of which is
described below.

Academic and Clinical Excellence

Clinical Programs and Services. At the Hospital, clinical care for children and expectant
mothers is primarily organized into six “Centers of Excellence” (the “Centers”). These Centers focus
on brain and behavior; cancer and blood diseases; cystic fibrosis and pulmonary disease; pediatric
congenital heart disease; pregnancy and newborn services; and transplantation and tissue engineering.
Each Center serves severely and chronically ill pediatric patients from throughout the world. In

<div class="ocr">addition to the services provided through the Centers, LPCH provides outreach and community service
programs and a full range of medical and surgical subspecialties.

Brain and Behavior Center (the “Brain Center”). The Brain Center specializes in treating
disorders of brain development and function, which may manifest themselves in behavioral, emotional,
learning, language, development, sensation or movement abnormalities. It combines the expertise of
specialists in a broad range of diseases, including epilepsy, autism and developmental disorders,
movement disorders, cerebrovascular disorders, depression, bipolar and anxiety disorders, traumatic
brain injury, neurogenetic disorders, brain tumors and congenital central nervous system defects. It
differentiates itself by focusing on behaviors post-intervention. The Brain Center’s governance
structure is designed to support integration and collaboration efforts with psychiatry partners. Programs
within the Brain Center include the Center for Brain Tumors, the eating disorder program and the
Center for Brain Outcomes. The Center for Brain Tumors within this Center is one of 10 members of
the National Cancer Institute’s Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium. The eating disorder program links
an inpatient program with an evidence-based outpatient program that coordinates medical and
psychiatric treatment. A Center for Brain Health Outcomes is being built that can capture both
retrospective and prospective data to help define national quality indicators and continue to improve the
long-term quality of life. In all of the Brain Center’s programs, psychiatrists, psychologists,
neurosurgeons and neurologists work closely with basic researchers to discover the inner workings of
the brain and how it impacts behavior so that children coping with complex conditions may lead more
full and productive lives.

In fiscal year 2016, the Brain Center’s inpatient activity increased 3%, from 828 discharges in
fiscal year 2015 to 853 discharges in fiscal year 2016. Forty-four percent of inpatients came from the
primary service area of San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, 30% came from the surrounding eight-
county Bay Area, 20% from other California counties and 6% from outside the State of California.

Bass Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases (the “Bass Center”). The Bass Center
offers comprehensive care and innovative therapies for children with cancer and blood diseases. This
facility integrates inpatient and outpatient care and has a 27-bed inpatient unit (15 hematology/oncology
beds and 12 stem cell transplant beds) along with a contiguous eight-bed day hospital, infusion room,
lab and clinic. The Bass Center also has eight beds allocated to support chemotherapy inpatient
infusions at the LPCH-licensed inpatient unit at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View, California. The
Bass Center is staffed by individuals trained in the specialized needs of pediatric cancer patients and
includes appropriate isolation rooms.

The Bass Center’s program diagnoses and treats approximately 240 new cancer patients per
year and performed 41 stem cell transplants in fiscal year 2016. The Bass Center’s goals are to offer a
comprehensive program that will serve more patients, to develop a more robust research platform and to
expand the Bass Center’s geographic reach to provide more children with access to the specialized
services offered by the Bass Center.

In fiscal year 2016, the Bass Center’s hematology/oncology service had a total of 1,177
inpatient discharges and the stem cell transplant service had a total of 65 inpatient discharges. The Bass
Center is a strong regional program with 54% of patients coming from the primary service area of San
Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, 29% from the eight surrounding Bay Area counties, 15% from other
California counties and 2% from outside the State of California.

Pulmonary Medicine and Cystic Fibrosis Center (the “CF Center”). The CF Center

integrates an interdisciplinary team of clinicians and researchers from LPCH and the Stanford School of
Medicine. Their combined efforts have produced a program that focuses on care of children with a

<div class="ocr">plethora of respiratory and pulmonary conditions, from the common and simple to the complex and
rare. The CF Center is one of the largest care providers for children with conditions such as cystic
fibrosis, asthma, chronic lung disease of infancy resulting from premature birth and immature lungs,
acute or chronic respiratory infections, multi-system disorders that affect breathing and lungs such as
cerebral palsy, neuromuscular diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy and other muscular dystrophies,
as well as other genetic and metabolic disorders that impact swallowing and breathing. In addition, the
Center is home to a dedicated pediatric sleep program and operates one of the few active lung transplant
programs in the United States dedicated exclusively to children.

Betty Irene Moore Children’s Heart Center (the “Heart Center”). The Heart Center’s
mission is to bring together professional and facility resources under one Center of Excellence that
serves both LPCH’s local patients and the greater community. With a multidisciplinary team specially
trained to diagnose and treat infants, children and young adults with congenital and acquired heart
diseases, the Heart Center cares for children requiring specialized cardiothoracic services on a national
and international basis, drawing patients from all over California, at least 28 different states and several
different countries.

The program goals are centered on continuing the integration and expansion of the clinical,
administrative and academic activities to better serve LPCH’s pediatric population in cardiology,
cardiac surgery, cardiac intensive care, cardiac anesthesia and cardiac imaging. Additionally, LPCH
continues to focus on early identification of cardiac anomalies through LPCH’s Fetal Echocardiography
Program, in conjunction with the Center for Fetal and Maternal Health. LPCH’s Ventricular Assist
Device Program continues to grow to care for children most critically ill with advanced heart failure
and implanted 43 ventricular assist devices over the past three years. LPCH added the HeartWare
system to its armamentarium of implantable devices in appropriate cases, which allows for the early
discharge of patients on ventricular assist devices to a home setting while patients wait for their heart
transplant. With seven Board-certified providers, LPCH’s Adult Congenital Heart Disease (““ACHD”’)
Program has more Board-certified providers than any other ACHD program in the United States.

The number of inpatients served by the Heart Center was 1,022 in fiscal year 2016. Of these,
there were 565 cardiac surgeries and 17 heart transplants. The inpatient program had a Case Mix Index
(“CMI”), a measure of pediatric acuity and relative costs or resource needs to treat patients, of 4.5,
reflecting the medically complex population served by the Heart Center. In fiscal year 2016, 25% of
patients came from LPCH’s primary service area of San Mateo and Santa Clara counties, 29% came
from the eight-county Bay Area, 30% came from other areas within California and 16% came from
other states and countries.

It is anticipated that certain components of the Heart Center will move to the Expansion. See
“THE PROJECT” herein for additional information.

Johnson Center for Pregnancy and Newborn Services (the “Johnson Center”). The Johnson
Center encompasses maternity care and high risk obstetrics, as well as healthy newborn and neonatal
intensive care built on a successful academic-community hospital partnership.

The Johnson Center’s services include prenatal diagnosis, genetic counseling, high resolution
fetal ultrasound services, high risk prenatal care, delivery, lactation and parenting support and newborn
intensive care. In addition, the Behavioral-Developmental Pediatrics program offers long-term follow-
up for patients graduating from the Neonatal Intensive Care unit. In 2015, the Johnson Center began
offering fertility and reproductive health services, and providing a full range of services from pre-
conception to birth and beyond.

<div class="ocr">The Johnson Center also manages several clinical outreach services in maternal-fetal medicine,
providing early diagnosis and consultative services for high risk maternity care throughout the region,
including Redwood City, Mountain View, Fremont, Salinas and Santa Cruz.

The Johnson Center continues to lead in the development and evaluation of simulation training,
both in the laboratory and on-site. Simulation training provides staff and the community an opportunity
to learn in a supported environment.

Obstetric discharges from the Johnson Center increased 2.66% to 4,869 in fiscal year 2016
compared to the prior year discharges of 4,743. In fiscal year 2016, the average length of stay for
obstetric patients was 3.4 days. Obstetric patients from the primary service area counties of San Mateo
and Santa Clara accounted for 86% of obstetric discharges. Twelve percent of patients came from the
eight Bay Area counties and 2% from other California counties.

The Johnson Center Neonatal Intensive Care unit served a total of 1,510 inpatients in fiscal year
2016 with an average length of stay of 12.8 days. Of these inpatients, 68% were from the primary
service area, with 27% coming from the eight-county Bay Area and 4% from outside the Bay Area.

Pediatric Transplant Center (the “Pediatric Transplant Center”). The Pediatric Transplant
Center is a national leader in transplant volume with more than 25 years of experience performing more
than 1,600 pediatric organ transplants. Data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network
show that, from 2011 to 2016, LPCH has performed more pediatric organ transplants than any other
U.S. medical center. The Pediatric Transplant Center has become a destination center for the most
acute and complex cases, which require highly specialized care. In the January 2017 Scientific Registry
of Transplant Recipients release, LPCH’s kidney transplants had the best three-year graft survival in the
nation.

LPCH’s surgeons perform isolated liver and intestinal transplants and combined organ
transplants, including liver-kidney, liver-heart, liver-lung, and multi-visceral transplants. The surgical
team utilizes ABO-incompatible donors and segmental donor organs to increase the donor pool and
minimize the waiting period for transplants, which ultimately increases the transplant success rate.
LPCH offers kidney transplants to newborns with kidney failure from birth, infants with kidney failure
caused by structural abnormalities of the urinary system, children with major vascular anomalies or
accidents, patients who have been highly sensitized from prior transplants or transfusion, and mothers
carrying unborn children with major kidney defects.

Genomics, and Definitive and Curative Medicine. LPCH is partnering with the University and
SHC on two significant and developing clinical and research programs: Genomics, and Definitive and
Curative Medicine. Through these partnerships, LPCH intends to focus on the use of genomics to,
among other things, assign individualized treatment protocols and materially improve patient outcomes.
The Stanford Clinical Genomics Service plans to launch in early 2018 by bringing the Whole Exome
Sequencing bioinformatics and interpretation in-house. The Center for Definitive and Curative
Medicine was created “to cure the incurable” and provide cell and gene therapies to patients with
lifelong, debilitative diseases, with the intent to eradicate the genetic anomalies causing those
conditions. Through its translational research expertise and infrastructure, the Center for Definitive and
Curative Medicine has opened three first-in-human clinical trials with more in the development
pipeline.

Professional Services. The FPO effectively functions as the medical group for faculty

physicians who practice pediatrics or obstetrics. Over 600 physicians who are part of the FPO and
over 160 physicians and advanced practice providers who are part of PCHA together are known in the

<div class="ocr">marketplace as the “Stanford Children’s Health Physician Network.” This network provides
professional services at all Stanford Children’s Health locations. In fiscal year 2016, the FPO provided
250,862 visits, an increase of 8.51% from 231,182 visits in fiscal year 2015.

The Chief Medical Officer for LPCH and the Chief Administrative Officer for Physician
Practices for Stanford Children’s Health and Chief Executive Officer of PCHA together manage both
the FPO and PCHA. They are ex-officio board members of PCHA and the Chief Medical Officer for
LPCH is a shareholder and President of the Board of Directors of Packard Medical Group. The FPO
and PCHA have been on the same electronic medical record system (Epic) since the summer of 2014,
enabling close clinical integration and care coordination. The Stanford Children’s Health Physician
Network contracts as a single physician practice with managed care organizations. This organizational
alignment is designed to support the unique needs of faculty and community physician practices while
also ensuring consistent quality and standards of care.

Packard Children’s Health Alliance and Packard Medical Group. In 2011, PCHA and the
Packard Medical Group were formed and together they operate as a medical foundation. There is a
professional services agreement between PCHA and Packard Medical Group. Physicians who become
part of PCHA become employees of the Packard Medical Group and PCHA assumes responsibility for
all aspects of the physicians’ practice, including employee practice staff.

PCHA has been organized to operate community-based pediatric and obstetrics practices
throughout the Bay Area. The objectives of PCHA are to support the overall Stanford Children’s
Health Physician Network by building a presence in growing service areas, expanding education and
clinical research programs and enhancing the quality and coordination of care across different care
settings.

PCHA now includes over 160 physicians and advanced practice providers in 22 practices at 39
locations around the San Francisco Bay Area. PCHA also operates five of the Stanford Children’s
Health specialty services centers in Capitola, Emeryville, Fremont, Monterey and Walnut Creek.
Several of the PCHA practices provide professional services to the San Francisco Pediatric Venture,
LLC and Contra Costa Pediatric Venture, LLC. See “Expansion of LPCH’s Reach” below. LPCH and
PCHA management have set a goal to have a Stanford Children’s Health physician office (either PCHA
or FPO) within 10 miles of every family in the Bay Area. In fiscal year 2016, PCHA practices recorded
over 250,000 visits.

LPCH has entered into a Sponsorship Agreement with PCHA, wherein LPCH has agreed to
provide funding for the development and the operation of PCHA’s physician practices, including any
net operating losses and capital expenditures that otherwise cannot be funded by PCHA operating cash
flows. In fiscal year 2016, LPCH provided $9.4 million to PCHA in funding for operations and capital.
See Note | in the audited consolidated financial statements of LPCH attached as Appendix B to this
Official Statement.

Expansion of LPCH’s Reach

A principal focus of LPCH’s Vision 2025 is the extension of its capabilities in delivering high-
complexity care to its local and regional communities through partnerships with other hospitals and
physicians. These efforts are intended both to address the need for pediatric specialty care in the greater
San Francisco Bay Area and to increase LPCH’s integration with providers of lower-acuity care. In
addition, LPCH provides outreach and community service programs.

<div class="ocr">Future Development. LPCH continuously evaluates new business opportunities, which
may result in affiliations, acquisitions, joint ventures or contractual arrangements with other health
care providers or the restructuring of existing relationships. Such new business arrangements or
expansion or restructuring of existing relationships may involve financial commitments by LPCH
to other entities, which may be material in amount.

Outreach Programs. LPCH and pediatric and obstetrical specialists from the Stanford School
of Medicine have established a network of outreach programs both within LPCH’s primary and
secondary service areas and throughout the State and the western United States. For a description of
LPCH’s primary and secondary service areas, see “SERVICE AREA AND COMPETITION” herein.
These outreach programs generally offer services on a consult basis or through an office hours
arrangement in outpatient clinics staffed by physicians from LPCH’s medical staff. For NICU,
pediatric cardiovascular surgery, hospitalist services and some surgical specialties, services are
provided in an inpatient setting at community hospitals. Some pediatric outpatient surgical services are
also available at community hospitals. The outreach programs draw on the resources and skills of the
clinical staff, and LPCH provides only nominal indirect funding for such programs.

Community Service Programs. LPCH maintains a commitment to community service by
serving as a resource for health care services, information and support for the residents within its
primary and secondary service areas. Examples of major community benefit programs include:

e Operation of a mobile medical clinic providing comprehensive primary care to homeless and
uninsured youth in three San Francisco Bay Area counties

e Financial support to build pediatric and obstetric capacity in three federally-qualified health
centers in San Mateo County and limited financial support for a community health clinic in the
north part of Santa Clara County that services a low income population

e Financial support for the children’s health insurance program in Santa Cruz County

e Financial support for health services for a nonprofit organization on the coast of San Mateo
County

e Financial and technical support for a community collaborative seeking to improve the social
and emotional health of youth in Palo Alto

e Leadership and financial support as the lead agency for the Safe Kids Coalition for Santa Clara
and San Mateo counties

e Provision of numerous prenatal, perinatal, parenting and community health education programs
for the general community

Value-Based Systems

LPCH is evaluating and developing value-based and population health management capabilities
to improve its delivery system’s quality, safety and outcomes and meet the service, costs and access
expectations of patients and their families. LPCH participates in various value-based contracting and
accountable care organization opportunities, including the Stanford Health Care Alliance (“SHCA”) led
by SHC. SHCA was launched in 2014 as a narrow network product offered to employees of LPCH,
SHC and the University. In 2015, certain self-insured technology firms also began offering SHCA to

<div class="ocr">EDUCATION, TRAINING AND RESEARCH
Education

The Hospital serves as the primary pediatric teaching hospital of the Stanford School of
Medicine. As of August 31, 2016, the Existing Facility served as a training facility for approximately
62 full time equivalent (“FTE”) pediatric residents and approximately 118 FTE post-doctoral fellows
pursuing training in clinical specialties. These figures include the obstetrical and pediatric surgical
residents and fellows, as well as residents and fellows who rotate to the Existing Facility from adult
programs. LPCH’s Graduate Medical Education program, which is accredited by the Accreditation
Council Programs of the American Medical Association, is affiliated with the Stanford School of
Medicine. LPCH runs the pediatric residency program and pays the salaries and benefits of
participating residents and a portion of the salary and benefits of the director of the program as well as
the salary and benefits of other faculty who train the residents. As part of its mission, LPCH subsidizes
the costs of training physicians and residents in its clinics and inpatient areas. Some of these costs are
offset by funds received from the federal Graduate Medical Education program. During the fiscal year
ended August 31, 2016, LPCH received approximately $7.7 million in Graduate Medical Education
funding, which offset some, but not all, of LPCH’s costs to support the LPCH Graduate Medical
Education program. For a discussion of Graduate Medical Education funding, see “BONDHOLDERS’
RISKS—Business Relationships and Other Business Matters—Children’s Hospital Graduate Medical
Education Program” in the forepart of this Official Statement.

Training Programs
The Hospital serves as a center for graduate and postgraduate education sponsored by the
Stanford School of Medicine. Interns, residents and fellows sponsored by LPCH and the Stanford

School of Medicine are involved in research and patient care at the Hospital through their fellowships
or participation in pediatric rotations in the approved programs on the following page.

<div class="ocr">Research

Child and maternal health research programs are undertaken through the Stanford School of
Medicine whose faculty members are nationally recognized in the areas of basic science, translational
research and clinical pediatric and obstetric research. The strategic priority of the Stanford School of
Medicine with respect to research is to promote the development of those interdisciplinary research
collaborations most likely to lead to improved patient care and health outcomes through the exploitation
of new knowledge of biosciences and disease mechanisms. Interdisciplinary pediatric and obstetric
research programs relate to medical, surgical, pathology, radiology and cardiovascular departments
within the Stanford School of Medicine. The priority research programs in pediatrics and obstetrics
include prevention of preterm births, cancer biology, neuro-oncology, regenerative medicine and
developmental biology, molecular and cellular imaging, developmental immunology, definitive
molecular and gene therapies and molecular cardiology. The fulfillment of this research mission
depends in part on LPCH’s continued delivery of highly specialized care through its Centers of
Excellence.

LPCH and the Stanford School of Medicine established the Child Health Research Institute
(“CHRI’”), an initiative funded by philanthropy and grants whose goal is to facilitate advancement in
child and maternal health research at LPCH and the Stanford School of Medicine. CHRI also aims to
foster research by utilizing the innovations and technologies being developed by faculty at the Stanford
School of Medicine as well as the other University schools. The Chair of the Board of LPCH and the
Chief Executive Officer of LPCH represent LPCH on the CHRI Governing Board, which sets the
strategic priorities for CHRI. The CHRI Governing Board also has authority to make all decisions
regarding the use of philanthropic donations for CHRI, in accordance with the donor’s wishes. See
“OPERATING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Related Party Transactions—Transactions with
the University” herein.

THE PROJECT

The Existing Facility was designed in the 1980s to accommodate low-acuity pediatric patients
from the local community. It was also envisioned that LPCH would rely on SHC for the provision of
substantially all support services. Over time, LPCH developed into an institution that provides high-
acuity, specialized pediatric care. The redevelopment of the Existing Facility and the Expansion,
undertaken through the Project, is intended to bring the facilities to a level commensurate with LPCH’s
current role as a regional, national and international referral center for tertiary and quaternary pediatric
care. Substantial completion of construction of the Expansion, excluding imaging components and
operating rooms, occurred in July 2017 with patients expected to occupy the Expansion in December
2017.

The Expansion consists of two six-story towers (excluding the basements), an acute care
pavilion and an ICU pavilion which are located over a diagnostic and treatment platform, comprising a
total of 521,000 gross square feet of space, and a 420-space underground parking garage with an
additional 10 spaces above ground. The Expansion allows LPCH to increase storage capacity,
diagnostic/surgical procedure rooms, inpatient bed count and square footage per bed. Each pavilion has
been designed to house ancillary support services and amenities for families at the ground floor level,
the public concourse on the first level and patient beds on levels two through five. It is currently
anticipated that the Heart Center inpatient beds will be relocated to the second floor of the Expansion
upon the opening of the Expansion. A special room for children and their families with certain cancers
requiring high dose isotopes therapy has been incorporated into the bed plans on the fourth floor of the
acute care pavilion. It is anticipated that the Expansion will result in the addition of 149 beds,
comprised of 72 private pediatric ICU beds and 77 acute care beds (73 of the 77 acute care beds are

<div class="ocr">private rooms). The addition of these beds will allow LPCH to address the need for private rooms in
the Existing Facility.

It is currently planned that the fifth floor bed units in each tower will be shelled at initial
occupancy. The design of the fifth floor of each tower is in progress, and each fifth floor will house the
inpatient stem cell regenerative medicine and hematology/oncology patients. Special precautions for
immune-suppressed and infectious patients will include anterooms and airborne infection isolation in
specific patient rooms. Design of the south tower shell space for the first floor outpatient Heart Center,
neurodiagnostics and pulmonary lab departments is also in progress. Both the first and fifth floors of
each tower are targeted to open in the fall of 2019 and costs are expected to be fully funded by
philanthropy.

The diagnostic and treatment platform is designed to include technologically advanced surgical
suites, post-anesthesia care unit beds, interventional rooms and new rooms for diagnostic imaging
equipment, including MRIs, PET MRIs and nuclear medicine. These diagnostic procedure rooms will
tie directly into the Hospital’s surgical and imaging platform.

The Expansion is designed to include various environmentally sustainable elements. The
Expansion is architecturally oriented toward the sun’s movement and allows for natural air flow, and
these features are predicted to improve energy performance. It is anticipated that the Expansion design
will result in 38% less water usage than used in comparable hospitals and 60% less thermal energy
consumption than used in similar sized hospitals in the region. Additionally, the Expansion includes a
wind turbine to generate renewable energy.

Land use entitlements for the Project were secured from the City of Palo Alto (the “City’’) in
July 2011 under the terms of a 51-year development agreement for the comprehensive renewal and
replacement of facilities at LPCH, SHC and the Stanford School of Medicine. These entitlements
create a new hospital zone on the University campus and grant architectural approvals for the Project
construction.

Detailed construction plans have been submitted to OSHPD for approval on an incremental
basis synchronized with the approved construction schedule. LPCH has received OSHPD approval for
all seven increments of the Project. The general contractor for the Project is DPR Construction.

In addition, LPCH may use proceeds from the Bonds to fund routine capital expenditures of the
Hospital and to acquire the long-term ground lease interest in land and improvements located on the
University’s campus, adjacent to the Hospital, for future use.

The Project budget, originally set at approximately $1.2 billion likely is to be exceeded because
of cost increases related to changes in technology, change orders, and market availability of
subcontractors, among other factors. Sources of funding for the Project have consisted of $601 million
previously funded through the issuance of revenue bonds in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2016, grants funded
by the Children’s Hospital Bond Act of 2008, philanthropy and internal funds. In addition, a draw on a
line of credit with a total available amount of $200 million may be used to fund a portion of the Project.
See “OPERATING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION—Additional Revenue From the State of
California—Proposition 3 Funding” herein for information with respect to the grant funded by the
Children’s Hospital Bond Act of 2008. Management believes that such sources, together with the
proceeds from the Bonds, will be adequate to fund the remaining costs of the Project.

<div class="ocr">From fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2016, LPCH’s total discharges increased by approximately
1.6% and patient days increased by approximately 1.6%. The increase was largely driven by the
Johnson Center, the Cancer Center and the Brain Center. Fiscal year 2016 saw an increase in acuity in
the stem cell transplant program as well as the orthopedic service line, increasing the CMI for those
programs.

For the nine months ended May 31, 2017, compared to the nine months ended May 31, 2016,
LPCH’s total discharges and patient days decreased by approximately 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.
The Cancer Center and the Johnson Center were the primary drivers for the decreased volume, while
cardiovascular surgery and medical specialty patient days grew by approximately 1% and 7%,
respectively. The CMI in the orthopedic surgery and hematology/oncology programs grew due to the
increased acuity in these services.

Financial Data

The following table provides revenue and expense information for LPCH for the three fiscal
years ended August 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and for the nine-month periods ended May 31, 2016 and
2017. The financial information for the two fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2016 has been
derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of LPCH included in Appendix B of this
Official Statement. The financial information for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014 has been
derived from audited financial statements of LPCH not included in this Official Statement. The
financial information for the nine-month periods ended May 31, 2016 and 2017 has been compiled by
the management of LPCH and includes adjustments that management considers necessary to present
such information in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and
in a manner consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended August 31,
2015 and 2016. The results of operations for the nine-month period ended May 31, 2017 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full
fiscal year.

The financial results of PCHA are consolidated with those of LPCH for the fiscal years ended
August 31, 2015 and 2016 and for the nine-month periods ended May 31, 2016 and 2017. In
management’s view, the assets, liabilities and results of operations and changes in net assets and
revenues of PCHA are not material to LPCH. As of and for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016,
PCHA represented less than 1% of LPCH’s consolidated net assets and approximately 6% of LPCH’s
consolidated revenues. LPCH became the sole member of LPFCH as of September 1, 2016. The
financial results of LPFCH are consolidated with those of LPCH for the nine-month period ended May
31, 2017. In management’s view, the assets, liabilities and results of operations and changes in net
assets and revenues of LPFCH are not material to LPCH. As of and for the nine-month period ended
May 31, 2017, LPFCH represented approximately 5% of LPCH’s consolidated net assets and
approximately 1% of LPCH’s consolidated revenues. Neither PCHA nor LPFCH is a Member of the
Obligated Group or otherwise obligated with respect to the Bonds.

The financial data should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements of LPCH for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2015 and 2016, together with the related
notes and the consolidating information, included in Appendix B to this Official Statement, which have
been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent accountants.

<div class="ocr">Sources of Patient Service Revenue

General. In fiscal year 2016, approximately 53% of LPCH’s gross patient service revenues
were from commercial payers, including health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and preferred
provider organizations (“PPOs”) and approximately 41% were from Medi-Cal payer sources. LPCH
contracts with all major managed care organizations in its primary and secondary service areas.
Approximately 79% of LPCH’s gross patient service revenues are derived from inpatient services.

The following are summaries of gross and net patient service revenue by payer source for the
fiscal years ended August 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Medi-Cal. Effective July 1, 2013, the State of California changed its payment mechanism for
inpatient services provided to Fee-for-Service (“FFS”) Medi-Cal patients from per-diems to All-Patient
Refined Diagnosis Related Group (““APR-DRG”) methodology. Outpatient services to FFS patients
continue to be paid on the Medi-Cal fee schedule. Services to managed Medi-Cal patients are provided
through contracts with Medi-Cal county-based and commercial managed care organizations. See
“BONDHOLDERS’ RISKS—Patient Service Revenues—Medi-Cal Program” and “BONDHOLDERS’
RISKS—Patient Service Revenues—Medi-Cal Managed Care” in the forepart of this Official
Statement.

LPCH’s major managed Medi-Cal contracts include: the Health Plan of San Mateo, Anthem
Blue Cross, Central California Alliance for Health and the Santa Clara Family Health Plan, to provide
inpatient and outpatient care. Outpatient care for all four plans is reimbursed on a multiple tied to the
standard Medi-Cal fee schedule. Inpatient care is reimbursed on a per diem basis, which varies
according to the terms of LPCH’s contract with each of these plans. The exception is Health Plan of
San Mateo which was transitioned to APR-DRG reimbursement effective November 2016.

HMOs/PPOs. PCH contracts with all major health plans organized and operating in its
primary service area. The following table sets forth the five managed care payers for LPCH with the

LPCH participates in most types of health plan products, including PPO, Point of Service
(“POS”), Exclusive Provider Organization (“EPO”) and traditional indemnity plans. These agreements
include rates for obstetrics, pediatrics and transplant services. LPCH does not accept payment on the
basis of capitation with commercial payers.

LPCH’s current agreement with Anthem Blue Cross is effective through August 31, 2019.
LPCH’s agreements with Blue Shield of California and Aetna are effective through April 30, 2018 and
August 31, 2018, respectively; accordingly, these agreements are slated for renegotiation in 2018.

Additional Revenue From the State of California

Disproportionate Share Hospital (“DSH”) Funding. This program provides supplemental
payments to hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid that treat a disproportionately substantial
number of low income, uninsured and Medicare or Medicaid patients compared to other hospitals.
Private hospitals that meet DSH criteria are eligible for certain funding, known as stabilization or “DSH
replacement” funds. Funding is provided based on a hospital having met the eligibility criteria three
years prior to the funding year. Historically, LPCH has received DSH replacement funds for Medi-Cal
patients from time to time, including $9.4 million in fiscal year 2013. LPCH did not qualify for DSH
funding in fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Provider Fee Program. The State of California enacted State Assembly Bill 1383 in 2009, as
amended by State Assembly Bill 1653 in 2010, which established a Hospital Quality Assurance Fee
(“QAF”) Program and a Hospital Fee Program (collectively, the “Provider Fee Program’). The
Provider Fee Program imposed a quality assurance fee on certain California general acute care hospitals
that, combined with federal matching funds, would be used to provide supplemental payments to
certain hospitals and support the State’s effort to maintain health care coverage for children. Under the
Provider Fee Program, some California hospitals receive more funding in increased Medi-Cal
supplemental payments than the quality assurance fees paid, while other California hospitals receive
less money in Medi-Cal payments than fees paid. The effective period of the initial Provider Fee
Program was April 1, 2009 through December 31, 2010. Subsequent legislation allowed for three
additional QAF and Hospital Fee Programs, the latest of which was established by the Medi-Cal
Hospital Reimbursement Improvement Act of 2013 and was in effect from January 1, 2014 through
December 31, 2016. In December 2014, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (“CMS”)
approved the fee-for-service Medi-Cal supplement payments portion of this thirty-month extension.
CMS approved both the expansion population and non-expansion population portion of the first of four

<div class="ocr">potential managed care supplemental payments of this thirty-month program in April 2016 and June
2015, respectively.

The California Medi-Cal Hospital Reimbursement Initiative also known as Proposition 52,
approved by California voters in November 2016, will extend the Provider Fee Program indefinitely
and put protections in place to prevent diversion of funds from the program. LPCH participates in the
Provider Fee Program and pays both the QAF and the California Health Foundation and Trust pledge,
which are recorded in other expenses. LPCH receives supplemental payments from both DHCS and the
managed care plans, which are recorded in net patient service revenue. Provider Fee Program revenue
is recognized when CMS approves the relevant portion of Medi-Cal supplemental payments to the
State.

For the years ended August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, LPCH recognized $51.8, $79.8 million,
and $14.6 million, respectively, in net patient service revenue for Medi-Cal fee-for-service and
managed care supplemental payments and $24.2, $43.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively, in other
operating expense, which are included in LPCH’s consolidated statement of operations and changes in
net assets for quality assurance fees paid to California Department of Health Care Services.

Proposition 3 Funding. Proposition 3, known as the Children’s Hospital Bond Act of 2008,
was an initiative enacted by California voters. This Act authorized the issuance of $980 million in
bonds, to be repaid from the State’s General Fund, to support construction projects of children’s
hospitals. In August 2013, LPCH received $97.4 million (less costs of issuance and administrative
costs), which was applied to the costs of the Project.

Related Party Transactions

LPCH is party to several agreements, arrangements and transactions with SHC, the Stanford
School of Medicine and other entities related to the University relating to the provision of services to
the patients of LPCH.

Transactions with the University. LPCH records operating expense or equity transfers to
account for transactions with the University. LPCH purchases services from the University including
telecommunications, transportation, certain utilities, rent, legal, and internal audit. Costs incurred by
LPCH for these services purchased from the University were approximately $23.3 million and $28.3
million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively, and are recorded
as professional services, purchased services, and other expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations and changes in net assets for those fiscal years or as property and equipment, net, in the
consolidated balance sheets included in the audited consolidated financial statements of LPCH attached
hereto as Appendix B.

The total recoveries from the University including rent and certain salary and benefits were
approximately $3.5 million and $3.2 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and August 31,
2015, respectively. Clinical services purchased from the University are described in “Transactions with
the Stanford School of Medicine” below.

Transactions with the Stanford School of Medicine. Services purchased from the University
and, specifically, the Stanford School of Medicine, include clinical services that benefit LPCH,
including hospital-based physicians, medical direction, blood products, and medical library services.
Payment for these services is based on management’s best estimate of market value. On September 1,
2006, LPCH and the University entered into a Professional Services Agreement (“PSA”) which
assigned to LPCH the right to bill and collect all revenue related to pediatric and obstetric clinical

<div class="ocr">services on behalf of the Stanford School of Medicine faculty. In return, LPCH reimburses the
University for the services provided by the physician faculty. The PSA is revised periodically, most
recently as of September 1, 2016. The expense recorded related to payments and accruals for all of
these services amounted to approximately $209.1 million and $188.9 million for the fiscal years ended
August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The collections received from external parties by LPCH as
agent on behalf of the School of Medicine were recorded in other revenue and purchased services. The
amounts were $16.7 million and $12.7 million as of August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015,
respectively.

Transactions with SHC. LPCH and SHC share certain functions, including various
information systems, human resources, managed care contracting, and materials management. The
costs for these shared services, which are included in purchased services in the consolidated statements
of operations and changes in net assets, are allocated between SHC and LPCH based on management’s
best estimates. LPCH’s total cost for shared services was approximately $30.4 million and $28.6
million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

LPCH also purchases various services from SHC. These services include operating room,
cardiac catheterization, interventional radiology, radiation oncology, and laboratory. The cost of these
services, which is included in purchased services in the consolidated statements of operations and
changes in net assets, is charged back to LPCH based on a percentage of charges intended to
approximate costs or a cost per procedure. LPCH’s total cost for services purchased from SHC was
approximately $47.2 million and $47.1 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.

In addition to the services described above, LPCH purchases services from SHC that include
services provided by interns and residents, maintenance and certain operating expenses, including
utilities and capital projects. These services totaled approximately $33.4 million and $30.1 million for
the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in purchased services
and other expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets or in property
and equipment, net, in the consolidated balance sheets of LPCH.

Transactions with LPFCH. LPFCH operates as the exclusive fundraising entity for LPCH and
the child health and obstetric programs of the Stanford School of Medicine. On September 1, 2016,
LPFCH converted its corporate status from a nonprofit corporation without members to one with LPCH
as its sole member. LPFCH employs approximately 68 full-time equivalent employees devoted to
fundraising activities, including foundation gifts, private grants, corporate gifts, major gifts, planned
gifts and annual gifts. Since its creation in 1996, LPFCH has raised more than $1.6 billion for LPCH
and the child health programs of the Stanford School of Medicine, including a record $207 million in
fiscal year 2016.

In addition to soliciting cash donations and pledges for LPCH and the child health programs of
the Stanford School of Medicine, LPFCH coordinates the work of seven auxiliaries that collectively
have more than 1,000 members throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. The auxiliaries and their
individual members contribute an average of $1 million annually that is directed toward specific
programs including uncompensated care at LPCH.

LPCH purchases fundraising services provided by LPFCH and records the expense as
fundraising. See “FUNDRAISING” herein.

<div class="ocr">Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Recent Financial Performance

Certain Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. The preparation of the financial
statements of LPCH requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other
assumptions that it believes are reasonable and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States. Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis and makes
changes to the estimates as experience develops or new information becomes available. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The most significant estimates relate to patient accounts receivable allowances and self-
insurance reserves. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

All amounts set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Recent Financial
Performance have been rounded.

Patient Service Revenues. LPCH derived 53.3%, 41.0% and 5.7% of its gross patient revenues
in fiscal year 2016 from commercial insurers and managed care plans, Medi-Cal and other payers,
respectively. See “OPERATING AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION-Sources of Patient Service
Revenue.” Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided and are
reported at the estimated net realizable amounts; however, the complexity and extent of interpretation
from contracts and regulations could result in adjustments to these estimates. Estimates of contractual
deductions under managed care health plans are based upon payment terms specified in the related
contractual agreements and actual payment rates. The estimated reimbursement amounts are made on a
payer-specific basis and are recorded based on the best information available regarding management’s
interpretation of the applicable laws, regulations, contract terms and recent actual payment rates.
Management reviews the contractual deductions estimation process to consider and incorporate changes
in managed care contractual terms that result from contract renegotiations and renewals, as well as
changes in laws and regulations.

Provision for Doubtful Accounts. The collection of outstanding receivables from third-party
payers and patients is LPCH’s primary source of cash and is critical to its operating performance. The
amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management’s assessment of expected net
collections, based on historical experience and other collection indicators. Management relies on
detailed reviews of historical collections and write-offs. Adverse changes in business office operations,
payer mix, economic conditions or funding for governmental health care programs could affect LPCH’s
collection of accounts receivable, cash flow and operations.

Risk Management. LPCH self-insures for professional and general liability risks, workers’
compensation and a portion of employee medical and postretirement medical, as described below.
These liabilities are reflected as self-insurance reserves on the balance sheet. For information about
excess insurance and reinsurance coverage from third-party insurers, see “OTHER INFORMATION—
Insurance” herein.

e Professional and General Liability - LPCH is self-insured through SUMIT Insurance Company
Ltd. (“SUMIT”), a captive insurer that is jointly controlled by LPCH and SHC, for medical
malpractice and general liability losses under clatms-made coverage. SUMIT is rated “A” by
A.M. Best. For claims not covered by SUMIT, LPCH maintains professional liability reserves
and purchases coverage from third-party insurers, as described in “OTHER INFORMATION—
Insurance” herein.

Historical Performance
Nine Months Ended May 31, 2017.

Excess of revenue over expenses was $24.0 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2017,
as compared to $25.3 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of the
Provider Fee Program, excess of revenues over expenses was a loss of $1.7 million for the nine months
ended May 31, 2017 as compared to a gain of $10.1 million for the nine-month period in 2016,
principally due to a reduction in certain high-margin cases mostly in the period September 2016
through February 2017 and transition costs in connection with the Project, including the ramp up of
employee recruitment and training in preparation for the opening of the Expansion, which were offset
by higher investment income.

Total operating revenues were $1,083.2 million for the nine months ended May 31, 2017, as
compared to $1,028.1 million for the comparable period in 2016, an increase of approximately $55.1
million, or 5.4%. Net patient service revenue (excluding revenue from the Provider Fee Program)
increased $43.4 million, or 4.7%, for the nine months ended May 31, 2017, from the same period in
2016, mainly due to increases in outpatient volume and commercial managed care contract rates.
Revenue recorded under the Provider Fee Program for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 was $41.0
million, as compared to $33.6 million for the same nine-month period in 2016.

Total operating expenses increased $97.2 million, or 9.7%, period over period. Salaries and
employee benefits for the nine months ended May 31, 2017, increased by $66.1 million, or 15.5%, over
the same nine-month period in 2016 due to a combination of factors, including an increase in nursing
wages in connection with a new contract entered into with the nurses union referred to below under
“OTHER INFORMATION—Enmpployees” herein and a gradual ramp up of employee recruitment and
training in preparation for the opening of the Expansion. All other expenses (excluding expense from
the Provider Fee Program) increased in total by $34.3 million, or 6.1%, principally due to increases in
payments to the Stanford School of Medicine for services provided by the physician faculty. Expenses
recorded under the Provider Fee Program in the 2017 nine-month period were $15.3 million, as
compared to $18.5 million for the same nine-month period in 2016.

Total assets increased by $264.3 million, or 8.4%, from August 31, 2016 to May 31, 2017. Of
this increase, $187.4 million was the result of the consolidation of LPFCH, which was effective as of
September 1, 2016. Current assets decreased by $201.4 million, which was primarily due to usage of
cash to fund the ongoing construction costs related to the Project, while the increase in current liabilities
of $71.4 million is mainly due to LPFCH fundraising on behalf of the Stanford School of Medicine.
Investments increased $68.3 million, from August 31, 2016 to May 31, 2017, which was mainly
attributable to the consolidation of LPFCH. Total net assets increased by $200.3 million, or 9.1%, from
August 31, 2016 to May 31, 2017, reflecting the impact of consolidating LPFCH and income from

<div class="ocr">investments in the hereinafter defined Merged Pool and fundraising results, as offset by the loss from
operations and equity transfers to related parties.

Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended August 31, 2015.

Excess of revenue over expenses was approximately $48.4 million in fiscal year 2016, as
compared to $138.3 million in fiscal year 2015. This decrease in excess revenue over expenses was
primarily due to a decrease in income from operations (excluding the impact of the Provider Fee
Program) of $58.2 million primarily as a result of an increase in personnel costs in anticipation of the
opening of the Expansion. In addition, net investment income decreased by $21.8 million and net
revenues over expenses from the Provider Fee Program decreased by $9.0 million due to the timing of
CMS approvals for the 30 month program from 2014-2016. Operating income for fiscal year 2016 was
$38.6 million compared to $105.8 million in fiscal year 2015.

Total operating revenues increased $22.5 million, or 1.6%, from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year
2016. Net patient service revenue increased $37.3 million (excluding revenue from the Provider Fee
Program) from the same period in fiscal year 2015, mainly due to increased reimbursement from
commercial managed care payers, and an increase in outpatient visits. Other revenue increased in the
period by $12.7 million principally due to the increase in receipts of unrestricted donor funds.

Total operating expenses increased approximately $108.7 million, or 8.8% fiscal year over
fiscal year (excluding expense related to the Provider Fee Program). Salaries and employee benefits
increased by $66.7 million, or 12.9%, from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016 as LPCH began to
increase employee recruitment and training in preparation of the opening of the Expansion. All other
expenses (excluding expense from the Provider Fee Program) increased in total by $41.9 million, or
5.9%, principally due to increases in payments to the Stanford School of Medicine for services provided
by the physician faculty and higher supply costs resulting from usage of prosthetics, hemophilia factor
and surgical supplies. New outpatient facilities openings in Sunnyvale and Los Gatos also contributed
to one-time costs in fiscal year 2016. Expense recorded under the Provider Fee Program in fiscal year
2016 was $24.2 million, as compared to $43.2 million in 2015.

LPCH’s total assets grew by $286.0 million in fiscal year 2016, or 10.0%, driven by a
combination of cash generated from operations, strong investment and fundraising results, and an
investment of generated operating funds in property and equipment. Cash and cash equivalents
increased in fiscal year 2016 over fiscal year 2015 by 58.6%, or $197.0 million, due to a combination of
proceeds from the 2016 Series B Bonds combined with planned withdrawals from the Merged Pool,
partially offset by construction expenses related to the Project. Current assets increased $225.9 million,
or 34.2%, and current liabilities increased $21.2 million, or 8.7%. Within current assets, net patient
account receivables decreased by $3.6 million to $268.2 million, primarily due to improvements in
revenue cycle. Net property and equipment increased in fiscal year 2016 by $351.0 million, or 32.6%,
as compared to fiscal year 2015, mainly due to the construction of the Project and new outpatient
facilities in Sunnyvale and Los Gatos. Net assets increased $157.2 million in fiscal year 2016 over
fiscal year 2015.

Debt Service Coverage

The following table was prepared by management of LPCH and presents historical coverage of
maximum annual debt service on all long-term indebtedness of LPCH for the three fiscal years ended
August 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and pro forma debt service coverage for LPCH for the fiscal year
ended August 31, 2016, adjusted to reflect the issuance of the Bonds. Income available for debt service
is calculated in accordance with the covenant requirements of the Master Indenture.

Investments. Oversight of LPCH’s cash and investment portfolio is provided by the Finance
Committee of the Board. Cash is invested to preserve capital through minimizing market and credit
risk.

Investments of LPCH are managed by the Stanford Management Company, the investment
management division of the University. The investment assets of LPCH are primarily invested in a
merged endowment pool that combines the assets of multiple entities (the “Merged Pool’). The
Merged Pool is a diversified fund comprised of a variety of investments, including cash and cash
equivalents, government and corporate debt securities, equity securities and mutual funds, real estate
and investments in partnerships, among other investments. LPCH’s interest in the Merged Pool is
accounted for on a share basis, reflecting LPCH’s proportionate share of the interest, dividends and
realized gains or losses of the securities held in the pool. Investment earnings are included in the excess
of revenues over expenses, unless the investment earnings are restricted by donor or by law.

At May 31, 2017, LPCH had approximately $1.19 billion of cash and investments, compared
with $1.21 billion at August 31, 2016 and $1.37 billion at August 31, 2015. At May 31, 2017, $331.8
million were cash and cash equivalents and $859.7 million were investments. At August 31, 2016,
approximately $532.9 million were cash and cash equivalents and approximately $679.2 million were
investments. At August 31, 2015, approximately $335.9 million were cash and cash equivalents and
approximately $1.04 billion were investments.

<div class="ocr">FUNDRAISING

Charitable fundraising has historically provided significant financial support to LPCH and
fundraising results have continued to be strong. LPFCH is the primary community fundraising agent
for LPCH. All contributions raised by LPFCH that are designated for LPCH are reported as revenues
of LPCH. In fiscal year 2016, LPFCH raised more than $207 million, of which $142 million was
allocated to LPCH.

A campaign launched by LPFCH in 1999, Campaign for Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital
(the “1999 Campaign’), raised a total of $526 million, of which $385 million was allocated to LPCH.
The 1999 Campaign focused on raising funds to support LPCH’s program development, the
establishment of six Centers of Excellence, facility expansion and endowment growth, as well as
faculty recruitment and pediatric program development at the Stanford School of Medicine.

A campaign launched by LPFCH in 2005, Breaking New Ground (the “2005 Campaign’’),
raised a total of $262 million for the Project. The 2005 Campaign focused on raising funds to support
the Project, to support program development and to endow fellows and faculty scholars in child health
programs at the Stanford School of Medicine.

In December 2012, LPFCH began the quiet phase of a fundraising campaign with an
anticipated goal of at least $750 million (the “New Campaign”). The New Campaign is a
comprehensive joint campaign with the Stanford School of Medicine that focuses on raising funds to
support completion of the first and fifth floors of the Expansion, to support the Hospital’s programs, to
support research and to endow faculty leaders at the Stanford School of Medicine. As of July 15, 2017,
the New Campaign has raised over $560 million, of which over $271 million was allocated to LPCH.

Together, the 2005 Campaign and the New Campaign have raised a total of $265 million for
the construction of the Project, other than the first and fifth floors of the Expansion. As of May 31,
2017, $256 million has been collected in cash. The balance consists of pledges and intentions to
give. Intentions to give enable donors to fulfill their commitments through a family foundation or
donor-advised fund.

<div class="ocr">and unit secretary job categories, which represent approximately 9% of LPCH employees. The current
contract with SEIU-UHW expires on August 26, 2017. Negotiations on a new agreement, which began
on June 15, 2017, are ongoing.

Retirement Plans

LPCH provides retirement benefits through defined benefit and defined contribution retirement
plans covering substantially all benefit-eligible employees and employees previously leased from SHC.

Defined Contribution Retirement Plan. Employer contributions to the defined contribution
retirement plan are based on a percentage of participant annual compensation. Employer contributions
to this plan which are vested immediately to participants totaling approximately $29.0 million and
$27.0 million for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, are included in salaries and
benefits expense in the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets included in the
audited consolidated financial statements attached as Appendix B to this Official Statement.

Postretirement Medical Benefit Plan. LPCH currently provides health insurance coverage for
certain of its employees, through the SHC plan, upon retirement as early as age 55, with years of
service as defined by specific criteria. The health insurance coverage for retirees who are under age 65
is the same as that provided to active employees. A Medicare supplement option is provided for
retirees over age 65.

For purposes of the August 31, 2016 benefit plan liability valuations, LPCH has assumed future
mortality according to the RP 2014 White Collar mortality table and MSS 2007 projection table, which
are based on the rates published by the Social Security Administration and which are used by LPCH’s
outside actuaries to estimate LPCH’s liabilities related to defined contribution and postretirement
medical benefit plans.

LPCH has recorded a liability totaling approximately $16.7 million and $18.2 million for the
years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, included in self-insurance reserves on LPCH’s
consolidated balance sheets. This represents the obligation for its employees and previously leased
employees. LPCH reimburses SHC for costs related to this plan on a periodic basis, and in 2016 has
recorded expense of $159,000 and an increase of approximately $1.6 million to net assets to reduce the
minimum benefit liability.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans. Certain LPCH employees are covered by a noncontributory
defined benefit pension plan held by SHC. SHC’s defined benefit pension plan benefits are based on
years of service and the employee’s contribution. Contributions to the plans are based on actuarially
determined amounts sufficient to meet the benefits to be paid to plan participants.

SHC and LPCH have an arrangement whereby SHC assumes the pension liability of the LPCH
employees and previously leased employees. However, LPCH is required to reimburse SHC for the
annual expense incurred for these employees and previously leased employees. LPCH paid $195,000
and $286,000 in cash for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which
represented current year pension expenses related to LPCH employees and previously leased
employees.

The remainder of certain other LPCH employees and previously leased employees not covered
by the previously described plans is covered by a frozen noncontributory defined benefit pension plan.
Benefits are based on years of service and the employee’s compensation. Contributions to the plan are
based on actuarially determined amounts sufficient to meet the benefits to be paid to plan participants.

Accreditation, Licenses and Memberships

LPCH is licensed by the California Department of Public Health and is accredited by The Joint
Commission. Its most recent three-year accreditation became effective November 2016.

LPCH is a member of the Children’s Hospital Association, the California Children’s Hospital
Association, the California Hospital Association, the Hospital Council of Northern and Central
California, Santa Clara County Division, the National Association of Children’s Hospitals and Related
Institutions and the American Hospital Association.

Insurance

LPCH maintains coverage of professional and comprehensive general liability through
programs of self-insurance and reinsurance. Primary and excess layers of such liability are insured
through SUMIT, under policies written on a claims made basis. SUMIT provides hospital liability
insurance covering general liability, health care professional liability, cyber liability, and miscellaneous
errors and omissions to LPCH and SHC (including the clinical activities of the Stanford School of
Medicine faculty and residents) on a combined basis.

For the policy year September 1, 2016 to September 1, 2017, SUMIT self-insures for the first
$15 million per claim loss and $25 million in the loss aggregate for claims by LPCH, SHC and the
Stanford School of Medicine. SUMIT has obtained $165 million of excess reinsurance jointly covering
LPCH, SHC and the Stanford School of Medicine. In addition to the excess reinsurance, SUMIT
purchases a “buffer policy” that provides $5 million per claim loss coverage and $10 million in loss
aggregate excess of the self-insured $10 million per claim loss and $15 million in loss aggregate. This
policy works to reduce the self-insured layer within SUMIT. For policy years before September 1,
2005 and since its creation in April 1, 2000, SUMIT provides occurrence-based coverage of the risk
related to the primary loss layer in amounts between $5 million and $15 million and has purchased
excess reinsurance in amounts between $100 million and $200 million. SUMIT has also assumed
coverage for professional liability of LPCH for occurrences during certain earlier periods.

SUMIT self-insures the first $1.25 million per claim for cyber liability coverage in excess of
$1.25 million per claim. SUMIT purchases $50 million of excess reinsurance jointly covering LPCH,
SHC and the Stanford School of Medicine.

In addition to coverage provided by SUMIT, LPCH obtains coverage of various risks under
policies issued by commercial insurers. These policies typically name SHC as well as LPCH and, as a
result, claims brought against one named insured can reduce coverage available to the others. LPCH
secures workers’ compensation coverage jointly with SHC under commercial policies for amounts in
excess of a deductible, which is $750,000 per claim, $20.5 million annual aggregate for the fiscal year
ending August 31, 2017. Workers’ compensation coverage is maintained in amounts consistent with
the statutory requirements of the State. LPCH obtains property damage and business interruption
insurance under commercial policies with limits shared with SHC in a blanket amount of $500 million
of coverage per occurrence, subject to various exclusions or limitations typical of an all risks property
policy. LPCH does not carry insurance for property damage or business interruption directly caused by
an earthquake; however, property damage or business interruption caused by fire, explosion, sprinkler
leakage or flood following an earthquake would be covered by the $500 million policy limit noted

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of

about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in

fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the
organization’s preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an
opinion on the effectiveness of the organization’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have
obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Opinion

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of LPCH and its entities at August 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of

Professional Exchange Insurance Company (“PEAC’”), a captive insurance carrier that entered into
business with SRA on October 18, 2012, provides professional liability insurance coverage for
physicians and other licensed healthcare practitioners of PCHA, University Healthcare Alliance (a
subsidiary of SHC) and other affiliated parties. PCHA’s share of net assets in PEAC was 29.4%
and 29.8% for the year ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. PCHA’s ownership in

PEAC is accounted for using the equity method. PCHA had an investment of $856 and $674 or the
years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which is reflected on the consolidated
balance sheets in other assets.

On September 1, 2006, LPCH and the University entered into a Professional Services Agreement
(“PSA”) pursuant to which the University assigned to LPCH the right to bill and collect all revenue
related to pediatric and obstetric practices on behalf of the University’s School of Medicine (“SoM”)
faculty as the LPCH Medical Group, a division of LPCH.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation
The accompanying financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting.

Net assets of LPCH and changes therein have been classified and are reported as follows:

e Unrestricted net assets — Unrestricted net assets represent those resources of LPCH that are
not subject to donor-imposed stipulations. The only limits on unrestricted net assets are broad
limits resulting from the nature of LPCH and the purposes specified in its articles of
incorporation or bylaws and limits resulting from contractual agreements, if any.

e Temporarily restricted net assets — Temporarily restricted net assets represent contributions,
which are subject to donor-imposed restrictions that can be fulfilled by actions of LPCH
pursuant to those stipulations or by the passage of time.

</p>
<p>7 
</p>
<p>� Permanently restricted net assets – Permanently restricted net assets represent 
contributions that are subject to donor-imposed restrictions that they be maintained by LPCH in 
perpetuity.  Generally, the donors of these assets permit LPCH to use all or part of the 
investment return on these assets. 
</p>
<p>Expenses are generally reported as decreases in unrestricted net assets.  Donor-imposed 
restrictions expire when the stipulated time period has elapsed, when the stipulated purpose for 
which the resource was restricted has been fulfilled, or both.  Temporarily restricted contributions 
are recorded as temporarily restricted net assets when received and when the restriction expires, 
the net assets are shown as released from restriction in the Consolidated Statements of Operations 
and Changes in Net Assets.  Income earned on temporarily restricted or permanently restricted net 
assets for which that income is restricted for a stipulated purpose is recorded in temporarily 
restricted net assets.  When income is made available for release and when the restriction is 
deemed to have been met, those amounts are included in net assets released from restrictions in 
the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets. 
</p>
<p>Transfers to Related Parties 
Certain amounts previously received from donors have been transferred to related parties.  
</p>
<p>Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposits and money market mutual funds 
with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased.  These amounts are carried at 
cost which approximates fair value.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, insures 
a corporation’s funds deposited in a bank up to a maximum of $250 in the event of a bank failure. 
As of August 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents held in bank deposits exceeded the FDIC 
insured amount. We have not experienced any losses in relation to cash and cash equivalents in 
excess of FDIC insurance limits.    
</p>
<p>Assets Limited as to Use, Held by Trustee 
Assets limited as to use primarily include assets held by trustees under bond indenture 
agreements.  The bond indenture terms require that the trustee control the disbursement of bond 
proceeds for capital projects.  Assets limited as to use consist of money market funds for the year 
ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Fair values are based on quoted market prices or 
broker or dealer price quotations on a specific identification basis. 
</p>
<p>Contributions Receivable 
Contributions are recorded at fair value at the date the promise is received.  Donations for specific 
purposes are reported as either temporary or permanently restricted net assets and are included as 
restricted contributions.  Contributions to be received after one year are discounted at an 
appropriate discount rate commensurate with the risks involved and applicable to the years in 
which the promises are received, and recorded in their respective net asset category.  The discount 
rates used during the year ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 were determined using Moody’s 
average corporate AAA bond rate.  Amortization of the discount is included in contribution revenue 
in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets.  Conditional promises to 
give are recognized when the condition is substantially met. 
</p>
<p>Other Receivables 
Other receivables are comprised of nonpatient related receivables for medical services provided.  </p>

<p>Investments 
Investments held directly by LPCH consist primarily of mutual funds classified as trading securities 
and are stated at fair value.  Investment earnings (including realized gains and losses on 
investments, interest, dividends and impairment loss on investment securities) are included in 
investment income unless the income or loss is restricted by donor or law.  Income on investments 
of donor restricted funds is added to or deducted from the appropriate net asset category based on 
the donor’s restriction.   
</p>
<p>Investments in University Managed Pools 
Investments in University managed pools consist of funds invested in the University’s Merged Pool 
(“MP”).  The value of its share of the MP is determined by the University, and is based upon the fair 
value of the underlying assets held in the MP.  Earnings include distributions and increases or 
decreases in the value of LPCH’s share of the pool.  LPCH may deposit funds in the MP at its 
discretion; however, withdrawals require advance notice.  All investment gains and losses and the 
increases or decreases in the share value are treated as unrealized and included in the excess of 
revenues over expenses, unless the income is restricted by donor or law.

<p>Board Designated Funds in University Managed Pools 
LPCH’s board of directors approved designating $213,111 in 2014 for future investment in facilities, 
programs, and services over which the Board retains control and may at its discretion subsequently 
use for other purposes.  As of August 31, 2016, the remaining balance of board designated funds 
was $9,214.  These funds are primarily invested in the MP and were funded from cash and cash 
equivalents.  In accordance with the instructions of the Board, investment returns earned on board 
designated funds are treated as unrestricted income with the principal to remain intact until 
required for future investment in facilities, programs, and services. 
</p>
<p>Beneficial Interest in Trusts 
Beneficial interest in trust represent gifts for which LPCH is the trustee and the remainder 
beneficiary of certain charitable remainder trusts, where the trust assets are invested and 
administered by outside trustees.  Beneficiaries sustain a lifetime interest in a portion of the trust 
income. Investments held in these trusts are carried at fair value. The discount rate used during the 
year ended August 31, 2016 and 2015 were determined using the T-bill rate. The related liabilities 
are based on estimated future cash receipts discounted at 1.46% for the year ended August 31, 
2016 and ranging from 0.36% to 2.18% for the year ended August 31, 2015.

portion of these premiums is included in long-term debt.

Excess of Revenues Over Expenses

The Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets include excess of
revenues over expenses. Changes in unrestricted net assets which are excluded from excess of
revenues over expenses include permanent transfers of assets to and from affiliates for other than
goods and services, contributions of long-lived assets (including assets acquired using
contributions which by donor restriction were to be used for the purposes of acquiring such assets),
adjustment for minimum pension liability, and transfer of funds related to underwater endowments.

Net Patient Service Revenue

Net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients,
third-party payors including Medi-Cal and others for services rendered. The contractual
commitments and laws and regulations governing the payment for services for government (Medi-
Cal and Medicare) and commercial payors are extremely complex and subject to interpretation. As

<p>coverage.  LPCH also maintains professional liability reserves for claims not covered by 
SUMIT which totals $1,761 and $1,891 for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively.  For the policy year’s September 1, 2015 to September 1, 2016, SUMIT retains 
100% of the risk related to the first $15,000 per occurrence subject to $25,000 aggregate.  The 
next $165,000 is transferred to various reinsurance companies rated “A” or better by AM Best 
rating agency.  For the policy year’s September 1, 2014 to September 1, 2015, SUMIT retained 
100% of the risk related to the first $15,000 per occurrence subject to $25,000 aggregate.  The 
next $150,000 was transferred to various reinsurance companies rated “A” or better by AM 
Best rating agency. 
</p>
<p>� Postretirement Medical Benefits – Liabilities for post-retirement medical claims for current 
and retired employees are actuarially determined by SHC and allocated to LPCH. 
</p>
<p>� Health, Dental and Vision – Liabilities for health, dental and vision claims for current 
employees are based on estimated costs. 
</p>
<p>� Workers’ Compensation – LPCH purchases insurance for workers’ compensation claims with 
a $750 deductible per occurrence.  Workers’ compensation insurance provides statutory limits 
for the State of California.  An actuarial estimate of retained losses (or losses retained within 
the deductible) has been used to record a liability. 
</p>
<p>Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
Due to the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued 
liabilities, and accrued salaries and related benefits, their carrying value approximates their fair 
value. 
</p>
<p>Transactions with the University 
LPCH enters into various transactions with the University.  LPCH records expense transactions 
where direct and incremental economic benefits are received by LPCH.  Certain expenses are 
allocated from the University to LPCH.  Allocated expenses reported as operating expenses in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets are management’s best 
estimates of LPCH’s arms-length payment of such amounts for its market specific circumstances.  
To the extent that payments to the University exceed an arms-length estimated amount relative to 
the benefit received by LPCH, they are recorded as transfers to the University. 
</p>
<p>Concentration of Credit Risk 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject LPCH to concentrations of credit risk, consist 
principally of cash and cash equivalents, patient accounts receivable, and investments in University 
managed pools (Note 6). 
</p>
<p>LPCH invests its cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial instruments including insured 
deposits.  As of August 31, 2016, LPCH has invested its cash and cash equivalents with a financial 
institution in excess of federal depository insurance limits. 
</p>

coverage. LPCH also maintains professional liability reserves for claims not covered by
SUMIT which totals $1,761 and $1,891 for the years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. For the policy year’s September 1, 2015 to September 1, 2016, SUMIT retains
100% of the risk related to the first $15,000 per occurrence subject to $25,000 aggregate. The
next $165,000 is transferred to various reinsurance companies rated “A” or better by AM Best
rating agency. For the policy year’s September 1, 2014 to September 1, 2015, SUMIT retained
100% of the risk related to the first $15,000 per occurrence subject to $25,000 aggregate. The
next $150,000 was transferred to various reinsurance companies rated “A” or better by AM
Best rating agency.

e Postretirement Medical Benefits — Liabilities for post-retirement medical claims for current
and retired employees are actuarially determined by SHC and allocated to LPCH.

e Health, Dental and Vision — Liabilities for health, dental and vision claims for current
employees are based on estimated costs.

e Workers’ Compensation —LPCH purchases insurance for workers’ compensation claims with
a $750 deductible per occurrence. Workers’ compensation insurance provides statutory limits
for the State of California. An actuarial estimate of retained losses (or losses retained within
the deductible) has been used to record a liability.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Due to the short-term nature of cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued
liabilities, and accrued salaries and related benefits, their carrying value approximates their fair
value.

Transactions with the University

LPCH enters into various transactions with the University. LPCH records expense transactions
where direct and incremental economic benefits are received by LPCH. Certain expenses are
allocated from the University to LPCH. Allocated expenses reported as operating expenses in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Changes in Net Assets are management’s best
estimates of LPCH’s arms-length payment of such amounts for its market specific circumstances.
To the extent that payments to the University exceed an arms-length estimated amount relative to
the benefit received by LPCH, they are recorded as transfers to the University.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments, which potentially subject LPCH to concentrations of credit risk, consist
principally of cash and cash equivalents, patient accounts receivable, and investments in University
managed pools (Note 6).

LPCH invests its cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial instruments including insured
deposits. As of August 31, 2016, LPCH has invested its cash and cash equivalents with a financial
institution in excess of federal depository insurance limits.

LPCH’s concentration of credit risk relating to patient accounts receivable is limited by the diversity
and number of the patients and payers. Patient accounts receivable consists of amounts due from
governmental programs, commercial insurance companies, private pay patients, and other group
insurance programs.

<p>Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are

7. Fair Value Measurements

U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) defines fair value as the price received
upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants and establishes a hierarchy of valuation inputs based on the extent to which the inputs
are observable in the marketplace. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from
independent sources. In contrast, unobservable inputs reflect the entity’s assumptions about how
market participants would value the financial instrument. Valuation techniques used under U.S.
GAAP must maximize the use of observable inputs to the extent available.

The following describes the hierarchy of inputs used to measure fair value and the primary
valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, at the reporting date,
without adjustment. Market price data is generally obtained from relevant exchange or
dealer markets.

Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as
quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not
active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market
data for substantially the same term of the assets or liabilities. Inputs are obtained from
various sources including market participants, dealers and brokers.

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

A financial instrument’s categorization within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following table summarizes consolidated LPCH’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value
as of August 31, 2016, based on the inputs used to value them.

In 2003, LPCH entered into a master indenture of trust (the “LPCH Master Indenture”) as the sole
initial member of an obligated group (“LPCH Obligated Group”), the purpose of which is to provide
for issuance of obligations (“Obligations”) to secure indebtedness of the members of the LPCH
Obligated Group on a joint and several basis.

Obligations issued under the LPCH Master Indenture are collateralized by a lien on the gross
revenues of LPCH. The LPCH Master Indenture also includes various covenants, the most
restrictive of which include maintenance of a minimum annual debt service coverage ratio,
limitations on additional indebtedness, restrictions on the disposition or transfer of assets, mergers
and entry into and withdrawal from the LPCH Obligated Group. During the year ended August 31,
2016, LPCH was in compliance with its covenants.

In July 2003, California Health Facilities Financing Authority (“CHFFA’) issued, on behalf of LPCH,
revenue bonds in the aggregate par amount of $115,000 (collectively, the “2003 Bonds”). The

The discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, and the projected covered payroll growth
rates used in determining the above accrued benefit costs are as follows for the years ended

August 31:
2016 2015
Weighted average assumptions
to determine net periodic benefit costs
Discount rate 4.03 % 3.66 %
Rate of compensation increase N/A N/A
Expected return on assets 5.50 % 6.25 %

LPCH utilizes an independent investment consulting firm to provide an estimate of the future
expected returns for each asset class based on LPCH’s asset allocation targets. The evaluation of
the future expected returns resulted in the use of 5.50% as the assumption for the expected return
on plan assets.

<p>Return Objectives and Risk Parameters 
LPCH has adopted endowment investment and spending policies that attempt to provide a 
predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain 
the purchasing power of endowment assets.  Under this policy, the return objective for the 
endowment assets is to generate optimal total return while maintaining an appropriate level of risk 
for LPCH.  LPCH expects its endowment funds over time, to provide at least an average rate of 
return of approximately 5% annually.  Actual returns in any given year may vary from this amount. 
</p>
<p>Strategies Employed for Achieving Investment Objectives 
To achieve its long-term rate of return objectives, LPCH relies on a total return strategy in which 
investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized gains) 
and current yield (interest and dividends).  LPCH targets a diversified asset allocation that places 
greater emphasis on types of investments as described in Note 6 to achieve its long-term 
objectives within prudent risk constraints.  Portfolio asset allocation targets as well as expected 
risk, return and correlation amongst the asset classes are reevaluated annually by the asset 
manager and reported to the Board of Directors.

<p>Transactions with Stanford School of Medicine (SoM) 
Services purchased from the University and specifically, the Stanford School of Medicine, include 
clinical services that benefit LPCH, including hospital based physicians, medical direction, blood 
products, and medical library services.  Payment for these services is based on management’s 
best estimate of market value.  On September 1, 2006, LPCH and the University entered into a 
Professional Services Agreement (“PSA”) which assigned to LPCH the right to bill and collect all 
revenue related to pediatric and obstetric clinical services on behalf of the Stanford School of 
Medicine faculty.  In return, LPCH reimburses the University for the services provided by the 
physician faculty.  The PSA is revised periodically, most recently as of September 1, 2010.  The 
expense recorded related to payments and accruals for all of these services amounted to 
approximately $209,132 and $188,900 for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, 
respectively.  The collections received from external parties by LPCH as agent on behalf of SoM 
was recorded in other revenue and purchased services.  The amounts were $16,737 and $12,700 
as of August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015, respectively.

charge plus expenses, payable monthly, for core services, as defined, and additional fees plus 
expenses for special projects.  The annual fixed service charges are subject to adjustment under 
certain conditions, but unless so adjusted, amount to approximately $7,000 for each year through 
to 2018.  Adjustments are expected for variations in the number of devices, user demand, and 
project specific work that may increase the amount above the baseline in any given period.  LPCH

institute any suit, action or proceeding at law or in equity, for the protection or enforcement of any right 
or remedy under the Indenture, the Loan Agreement, Obligation No. 15 or any other applicable law with 
respect to such Bond, unless:  (1) such Holder shall have given to the Trustee written notice of the 
occurrence of an Event of Default; (2) the Holders of not less than twenty-five percent (25%) in aggregate 
principal amount of the Bonds then Outstanding shall have made written request upon the Trustee to

which is also absolute and unconditional, to enforce such payment by virtue of the contract embodied in 
the Bonds. 
</p>
<p>Termination of Proceedings.  In case any proceedings taken by the Trustee or any one or more 
Bondholders on account of any Event of Default shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any

of such Bonds and all unpaid interest thereon to maturity, except that, in the case of Bonds which are to 
be redeemed prior to maturity and in respect of which notice of such redemption shall have been given as 
in the Indenture provided or provision satisfactory to the Trustee shall have been made for the giving of 
such notice, the amount to be deposited or held shall be the principal amount or Redemption Price of such

modified and amended in accordance therewith, and the respective rights, duties and obligations under the
Indenture of the Authority, the Trustee and all Holders of Bonds Outstanding shall thereafter be
determined, exercised and enforced under the Indenture subject in all respects to such modification and

Defeasance

Discharge of Indenture. The Bonds may be paid by the Authority or the Trustee on behalf of
the Authority in any of the following ways: (i) by paying or causing to be paid the principal or

Outstanding.

If the Authority shall pay all Bonds Outstanding and shall also pay or cause to be paid all other
sums payable under the Indenture by the Authority, then and in that case at the election of the Authority
(evidenced by a Certificate of the Authority filed with the Trustee signifying the intention of the
Authority to discharge all such indebtedness and the Indenture), and notwithstanding that any Bonds shall

and be completely discharged and satisfied.

any cost, liability or expense related thereto, including, without limitation, reasonable fees and expenses 
of its attorneys and advisors and additional fees and expenses of the Trustee or any Holder or beneficial

<p>Loan Default Events.  Each of the following events shall constitute a "Loan Default Event" 
under the Loan Agreement: 
</p>
<p>(a) Failure by the Corporation to pay in full any payment required under the Loan Agreement 
or under Obligation No. 15 when due, whether at maturity, upon a date fixed for prepayment, by 
declaration, or otherwise pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement or Obligation No. 15; 
</p>
<p>(b) If any material representation or warranty made by the Corporation in the Loan 
Agreement or in any document, instrument or certificate furnished to the Trustee or the Authority in 
connection with the issuance of Obligation No. 15 or the Bonds shall at any time prove to have been 
materially incorrect in any respect as of the time made; 
</p>
<p>(c) If the Corporation shall fail to observe or perform any covenant, condition, agreement or 
provision in the Loan Agreement on its part to be observed or performed, other than as described in 
subsection (a) or (b) above, or shall materially breach any warranty by the Corporation contained in the 
Loan Agreement, for a period of sixty (60) days after written notice, specifying such failure or breach and 
requesting that it be remedied, has been given to the Corporation by the Authority or the Trustee; except 
that, if such failure or breach can be remedied but not within such sixty (60) day period and if the 
Corporation shall have taken all action reasonably possible to remedy such failure or breach within such 
sixty (60) day period, such failure or breach shall not become a Loan Default Event for so long as the 
Corporation shall diligently proceed to remedy such failure or breach in accordance with and subject to 
any directions or limitations of time established by the Authority, or the Trustee; 
</p>
<p>(d) Any Event of Default as defined in and under the Indenture; or 
</p>
<p>(e) Any Event of Default as defined in and under the Master Indenture. </p>

<div class="ocr">Bonds will be excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes and will take no action that
would result in such interest not being so excluded. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Corporation agrees to comply with the provisions of the Tax Certificate. This covenant shall survive
payment in full or defeasance of the Bonds.

Continuing Disclosure

The Corporation covenants and agrees to comply with the continuing disclosure requirements
promulgated under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 15c2-12, as it may from time to time
hereafter be amended or supplemented ("Rule 15c2-12"). Notwithstanding any other provision of the

from time to time hereafter be amended or supplemented, shall not be considered a Loan Default Event;
however, the Trustee, at the written request of any Participating Underwriter (as such term is defined in

PROPOSED FORM OF OPINION OF BOND COUNSEL
[Closing Date]

California Health Facilities Financing Authority
Sacramento, California

California Health Facilities Financing Authority Revenue Bonds
(Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford), 2017 Series A
Final Opinion

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as bond counsel to the California Health Facilities Financing Authority (the
"Issuer") in connection with issuance of $200,000,000 aggregate principal amount of California Health
Facilities Financing Authority Revenue Bonds (Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford),
2017 Series A (the "Bonds"), issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of August 1, 2017 (the
"Indenture"), between the Issuer and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee").
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture.

In such connection, we have reviewed the Indenture, the Loan Agreement, dated as of
August 1, 2017 (the "Loan Agreement"), between the Issuer and Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital
at Stanford (the "Borrower"), the Tax Certificate and Agreement, dated the date hereof (the "Tax
Certificate"), between the Issuer and the Borrower, opinions of counsel to the Issuer, the Borrower and
the Trustee, certificates of the Issuer, the Borrower, the Trustee and others, and such other documents,
opinions and matters to the extent we deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth herein.

We have relied on the opinion of Ropes &amp; Gray LLP, counsel to the Borrower, regarding, among
other matters, the current qualification of the Borrower as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"). We note that the opinion is subject to a number of
qualifications and limitations. We have also relied upon representations of the Borrower regarding the
use of the facilities financed or refinanced with the proceeds of the Bonds in activities that are not
considered unrelated trade or business activities of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 513 of the
Code. We note that the opinion of counsel to the Borrower does not address Section 513 of the Code.
Failure of the Borrower to be organized and operated in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service's
requirements for the maintenance of its status as an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the
Code, or use of the bond-financed or refinanced facilities in activities that are considered unrelated trade
or business activities of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 513 of the Code, may result in
interest on the Bonds being included in gross income for federal income tax purposes, possibly from the
date of issuance of the Bonds.

The opinions expressed herein are based on an analysis of existing laws, regulations, rulings and
court decisions and cover certain matters not directly addressed by such authorities. Such opinions may
be affected by actions taken or omitted or events occurring after the date hereof. We have not undertaken
to determine, or to inform any person, whether any such actions are taken or omitted or events do occur or
any other matters come to our attention after the date hereof. Accordingly, this letter speaks only as of its
date and is not intended to, and may not, be relied upon or otherwise used in connection with any such
actions, events or matters. We disclaim any obligation to update this letter. We have assumed the
genuineness of all documents and signatures presented to us (whether as originals or as copies) and the
due and legal execution and delivery thereof by, and validity against, any parties other than the Issuer.
We have assumed, without undertaking to verify, the accuracy of the factual matters represented,
warranted or certified in the documents, and of the legal conclusions contained in the opinions, referred to
</div>
</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>D-2
</p>
<p>in the second and third paragraphs hereof.  Furthermore, we have assumed compliance with all covenants 
and agreements contained in the Indenture, the Loan Agreement and the Tax Certificate, including 
(without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future 
actions, omissions or events will not cause interest on the Bonds to be included in gross income for 
federal income tax purposes.  In addition, we have assumed that actions of the Borrower and other 
persons will not cause any of the Bonds to exceed the $150,000,000 limitation on qualified 501(c)(3) 
bonds that do not finance hospital facilities set forth in Section 145(b) of the Code.  We call attention to 
the fact that the rights and obligations under the Bonds, the Indenture, the Loan Agreement and the Tax 
Certificate and their enforceability may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, 
reorganization, arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting 
creditors' rights, to the application of equitable principles, to the exercise of judicial discretion in 
appropriate cases and to the limitations on legal remedies against authorities of the State of California.  
We express no opinion with respect to any indemnification, contribution, liquidated damages, penalty 
(including any remedy deemed to constitute a penalty), right of set-off, arbitration, judicial reference, 
choice of law, choice of forum, choice of venue, non-exclusivity of remedies, waiver or severability 
provisions contained in the foregoing documents, nor do we express any opinion with respect to the state 
or quality of title to or interest in any assets described in or as subject to the lien of the Indenture or the 
Loan Agreement or the accuracy or sufficiency of the description contained therein of, or the remedies 
available to enforce liens on, any such assets.  Our services did not include financial or other non-legal 
advice.  Finally, we undertake no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the Official 
Statement or other offering material relating to the Bonds and express no opinion with respect thereto. 
</p>
<p>Based on and subject to the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, as of the date hereof, we are of the 
following opinions: 
</p>
<p>1. The Bonds constitute the valid and binding limited obligations of the Issuer. 
</p>
<p>2. The Indenture has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes the valid and 
binding obligation of, the Issuer.  The Indenture creates a valid pledge, to secure the payment of the 
principal of and interest on the Bonds, of the Revenues and any other amounts held by the Trustee in any 
fund or account established pursuant to the Indenture, except the Rebate Fund, subject to the provisions of 
the Indenture permitting the application thereof for the purposes and on the terms and conditions set forth 
in the Indenture. 
</p>
<p>3. The Loan Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid 
and binding agreement of, the Issuer. 
</p>
<p>4. The Bonds are not a lien or charge upon the funds or property of the Issuer except to the 
extent of the aforementioned pledge.  Neither the faith and credit nor the taxing power of the State of 
California or of any political subdivision thereof is pledged to the payment of the principal of or interest 
on the Bonds.  The Bonds are not a debt of the State of California, and said State is not liable for the 
payment thereof. 
</p>
<p>5. Interest on the Bonds is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes 
under Section 103 of the Code and is exempt from State of California personal income taxes.  Interest on 
the Bonds is not a specific preference item for purposes of the federal individual or corporate alternative 
minimum taxes, although we observe that it is included in adjusted current earnings when calculating 
corporate alternative minimum taxable income.  We express no opinion regarding other tax consequences 
related to the ownership or disposition of, or the amount, accrual or receipt of interest on, the Bonds.

(without limitation) covenants and agreements compliance with which is necessary to assure that future

</p>
<p>purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect 
</p>
<p>Participants’ records.  Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their

<p>purchase.  Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details 
</p>
<p>of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect 
</p>
<p>Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction.  Transfers of ownership 
</p>
<p>interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect

<p>Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners.  Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates 
</p>
<p>representing their beneficial ownership interests in the Bonds, except in the event that use of the

under the New York Banking Law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York
Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning
of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the
provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. DTC holds and
provides asset servicing for over 3.5 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and
municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC’s participants
(“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct
Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic
computerized book- entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants’ accounts. This eliminates
the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and
non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain
other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing
Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company of DTC, National Securities Clearing
Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies.
DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available
to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and
clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant,
either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). DTC has a Standard &amp; Poor’s rating of AA+. The
DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com.

Purchases of Bonds under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants,
which will receive a credit for the Bonds on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual
purchaser of each Bond (“Beneficial Owner’) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect
Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their
purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details
of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect
Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership
interests in the Bonds are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect
Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates
representing their beneficial ownership interests in the Bonds, except in the event that use of the
book-entry system for the Bonds is discontinued.

To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Bonds deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are
registered in the name of DTC’s partnership nominee, Cede &amp; Co. or such other name as may be
requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Bonds with DTC and their registration
in the name of Cede &amp; Co. or such other DTC nominee do not effect any change in beneficial
ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Bonds; DTC’s records
reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Bonds are credited, which

</div>
<div class="page"><p/>
<p>E-2
</p>
<p>may or may not be the Beneficial Owners.  The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain 
</p>
<p>responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.
</p>
<p>Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct 
</p>
<p>Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial
</p>
<p>Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory 
</p>
<p>requirements as may be in effect from time to time.  Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to take 
</p>
<p>certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the 
</p>
<p>Bonds, such as redemptions, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Bond documents.  For 
</p>
<p>example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds for 
</p>
<p>their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners.  In the alternative, 
</p>
<p>Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the Trustee and request that 
</p>
<p>copies of notices be provided directly to them.
</p>
<p>Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC.  If less than all of the Bonds are being redeemed, 
</p>
<p>DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such 
</p>
<p>Bonds to be redeemed.
</p>
<p>Neither DTC nor Cede &amp; Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect 
</p>
<p>to Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s Money Market Instrument 
</p>
<p>Procedures.  Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Authority as soon as 
</p>
<p>possible after the record date.  The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede &amp; Co.’s consenting or voting rights 
</p>
<p>to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a 
</p>
<p>listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).
</p>
<p>Principal, premium, redemption proceeds, and interest payments on the Bonds will be made 
</p>
<p>to Cede &amp; Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.  
</p>
<p>DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and 
</p>
<p>corresponding detail information from the Authority or the Trustee, on a payment date in 
</p>
<p>accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records.  Payments by Participants to 
</p>
<p>Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case 
</p>
<p>with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will 
</p>
<p>be the responsibility of such Participants and not of DTC nor of its nominee, the Trustee, the 
</p>
<p>Corporation or the Authority, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect 
</p>
<p>from time to time.  Payment of principal, premium, redemption proceeds, and interest to Cede &amp; Co. 
</p>
<p>(or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the 
</p>
<p>responsibility of the Corporation, the Authority or the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to 
</p>
<p>Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the 
</p>
<p>Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.
</p>
<p>DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Bonds at any 
</p>
<p>time by giving reasonable notice to the Authority or the Trustee.  Under such circumstances, in the event 
</p>
<p>that a successor securities depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and 
</p>
<p>delivered.
</p>
<p>The Authority may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry only transfers 
</p>
<p>through DTC (or a successor securities depository).  In that event, Bond certificates will be printed and 
</p>
<p>delivered to DTC.</p>
<p/>
<div class="ocr">may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain
responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct
Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial
Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory
requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to take
certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the
Bonds, such as redemptions, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Bond documents. For
example, Beneficial Owners of Bonds may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Bonds for
their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative,
Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the Trustee and request that
copies of notices be provided directly to them.

Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Bonds are being redeemed,
DTC’s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such
Bonds to be redeemed.

Neither DTC nor Cede &amp; Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect
to Bonds unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s Money Market Instrument
Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to the Authority as soon as
possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assigns Cede &amp; Co.’s consenting or voting rights
to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Bonds are credited on the record date (identified in a
listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy).

Principal, premium, redemption proceeds, and interest payments on the Bonds will be made
to Cede &amp; Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC.
DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and
corresponding detail information from the Authority or the Trustee, on a payment date in
accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by Participants to
Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case
with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name,” and will
be the responsibility of such Participants and not of DTC nor of its nominee, the Trustee, the
Corporation or the Authority, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect
from time to time. Payment of principal, premium, redemption proceeds, and interest to Cede &amp; Co.
(or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the
responsibility of the Corporation, the Authority or the Trustee, disbursement of such payments to
Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the
Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants.

DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Bonds at any
time by giving reasonable notice to the Authority or the Trustee. Under such circumstances, in the event
that a successor securities depository is not obtained, Bond certificates are required to be printed and
delivered.

The Authority may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry only transfers

through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Bond certificates will be printed and
delivered to DTC.
