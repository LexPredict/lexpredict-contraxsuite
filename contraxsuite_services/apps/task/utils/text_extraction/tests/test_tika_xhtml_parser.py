<p>The pen employed in finishing her story, and making it what you now see
it to be, has had no little difficulty to put it into a dress fit to be
seen, and to make it speak language fit to be read. When a woman
debauched from her youth, nay, even being the offspring of debauchery
and vice, comes to give an account of all her vicious practices, and
even to descend to the particular occasions and circumstances by which
she ran through in threescore years, an author must be hard put to it
wrap it up so clean as not to give room, especially for vicious
readers, to turn it to his disadvantage. <a href="#">This page{{##PGPG##}}
ends with semibold text</a>.
It is suggested there cannot be the same life, the same brightness and</p>
<p>
beauty, in relating the penitent part as is in the criminal part. If
there is any truth in that suggestion, I must be allowed to say ’tis
because there is not the same taste and relish in the reading, and
indeed it is too true that the difference lies not in the real worth of
the subject so much as in the gust and palate of the reader.</p>
