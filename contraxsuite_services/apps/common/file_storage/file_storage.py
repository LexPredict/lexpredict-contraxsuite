    """
    Accumulates several methods for accessing shared files from different machines of the Contraxsuite cluster.

    Contraxsuite is intended for running in a distributed environment and emulates a cluster even if running
    all services on a single machines. Usually the main/master machine is the one providing web services and also
    there are one or more Celery worker machines which load documents, do the field value extracting and several other
    things.

    Usually document files are loaded from clients into Contraxsuite via web API and next Celery worker machines
    need to access these files.

    Web API machine (UWSGI) is able to write files into its local folder while Celery workers have no straightforward
    access to UWSGI machine's file system.

    This is an abstract class providing methods for accessing files shared with some framework.
    Concrete implementations are in the descending classes.

    The methods of this class are specific for Contraxsuite purposes.
    As the most frequent use case is loading documents into the system there are few specific methods for
    accessing the "documents" sub-directory. They are here mainly as a code-reuse solution.
